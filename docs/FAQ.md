## General

### What do `SystemT` and `AQL` stand for?

`SystemT` is short of `SystemText`. It was originally invented in IBM Research - Almaden.
The name pays homage to [`SystemR`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System_R), short of `SystemRelational`, which was also invented in IBM Research - Almaden, in the 1970s. `SystemR` was the the first implementation of `SQL` (`Structured Query Language`), which has since become the standard relational data query language. The pioneering work done in `SystemR` laid the foundation of today's relational database systems such as IBM DB2, Oracle, Microsoft SQLServer.

`AQL` stands for `Annotation Query Language`, and yes, you've guessed, both its name and syntax are inspired by `SQL`.

### Are there overview scientific materials?

Yes, there are.
- An overview of SystemT's design at [NAACL 2018 Industry Track](https://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-3010)
- Formal semantics of AQL in [PODS 2013](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2594540) and [PODS 2014](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2699442)
- Declarative Information Extraction, or why AQL is so much faster and consumes less memory compared to cascading grammars and finite state transducers, in [ACL 2010](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1858681.1858695)
- AQL Algebra and the design of the SystemT Optimizer [ICDE 2008](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1547193)
