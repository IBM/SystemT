	Text Analytics has a rich set of APIs for invoking the Text Analytics
	engine directly from a Java program. Below are some general comments
	that apply to all of these APIs.

	<BR>
	<a id="exception">
		<h3>Exception Handling</h3>
	</a> During compilation, exceptions are wrapped into a single {@link
	com.ibm.avatar.api.exceptions.CompilerException}. During runtime, Text
	Analytics catches all exceptions and errors, including
	<code>RuntimeException</code>
	and attempts to re-wrap them as a {@link
	com.ibm.avatar.api.exceptions.TextAnalyticsException}. If the attempt
	fails, for example because of an unrecoverable error, the API will
	rethrow the original exception.

	<a id="uri">
		<h3>Supported URI Formats</h3>
	</a> Many operations in Text Analytics use URIs to specify the location of
	files to read and write. Compared to other applications, Text Analytics
	has a more flexible definition of what constitutes a valid URI.
	Specifically, URIs that do not contain a scheme are allowed. For more
	information on valid URI formats, see

		Handling in Text Analytics</a>.

	<a id="ext-file-format">
		<h3>External Artifact File Formats</h3>
	</a> Text Analytics supports specifying external artifacts (tables,
	dictionaries, and views) in a variety of file formats. For a detailed
	specification of supported formats, see

		formats for external artifacts</a>.
