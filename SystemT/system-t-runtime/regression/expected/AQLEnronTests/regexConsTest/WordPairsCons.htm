Hey there Bill!<br>
<br>
I thought I'd drop <font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>a quick line just to do a quick introduction of</b></font><font color = gray>]</font> myself.<br>
Your buddy, Brendan, has offered your tou...<br>
[ snip! ]<br>
... but everytime I write it out it<br>
sounds more like <font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>a personal add then an introduction!<br>
<br>
Brendan tells me you are about to close on a</b></font><font color = gray>]</font> condo.  Congratulations!  I<br>
can't wait to have <font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>a place of my own!  Apartment life is horrible.  My<br>
neighbor and I knock on the</b></font><font color = gray>]</font> bathroom wall at each other in the mornings just<br>

[ snip! ]<br>
...once compared landing in New Mexico to landing in <font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>a litter box.<br>
Where there's not dirt there's piles of crap.  Now everytime a</b></font><font color = gray>]</font> plane flies<br>
me back home I look around and agree.<br>
<br>
So, to say <font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>the least I'm a little stir crazy for a new environment.  The<br>
first part of</b></font><font color = gray>]</font> August I will be moving to Newport Beach, California.  Or one<br>

experience to kick in and lead <font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>the way later.<br>
<br>
As of</b></font><font color = gray>]</font> yet I have no set plans as to dates, iteneraries, etc and so forth.<br>
I'm <font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>a very spontaneous type of person I don't really "do" planning and<br>
