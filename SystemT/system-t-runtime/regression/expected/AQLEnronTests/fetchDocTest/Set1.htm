Thank you so much for writing back to me. I have been missing you like crazy without any way of getting in touch with you.  How are things going?  We have so much catching up to do.  I realize more than ever what a special friend you are and how much I have missed our conversations.  I hope all is going wonderful with you.  Things here are great.  I am almost done with my second year of school (only 2 more weeks)  I just took a comprehensive exam over the last 2 years and I think I passed.  I am constantly amazed that I am almost done with school and will soon be practicing medicine on poor innocent people.  I'll actually be in Seattle all of August and September, so hopefully we can arrange some kind of meeting so I can give you a big hug.<br>
How is work?  Are you still doing the same job?  I know last time we talked you had all kinds of crazy ideas floating around about moving to Europe or Japan or something crazy like that.  In fact, that is what I thought had happened and I was so scared that i would not be able to find you.  Do you still have your wonderful motorcycle?  I know you were moving to a new home the last time we talked, but I know nothing about it.  are you living by yourself, in a condo, a home, an apartment?  Anything else wild and crazy that I have missed hearing about?  I'm sure there is....<br>
Well, I just had to check something quickly off the internet before class today, and unfortunately I must go.  But it was wonderful to see your name and hear that you are alive and well.  I will definately be calling you this week to catch up.<br>
I have missed you my friend, take care,<br>

DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?<br>
Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS<br>
By Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas<br>
Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN &lt;http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&amp;d=t&gt; - news &lt;http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html&gt;) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS &lt;http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&amp;d=t&gt; - news &lt;http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html&gt;) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money.<br>
The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?''].<br>
Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder.<br>
CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business.<br>
Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg.<br>
For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron.<br>
``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli.<br>
That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.''<br>
Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons &amp; Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.''<br>
Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron? Don't bet the chalet on it.<br>

_________________________________________________________<br>
Task Force Taken to Task<br>
<br>
Western heavy load energy costs for Monday delivery were mostly steady from<br>
levels reported for the Friday/Saturday package as weather forecasts called<br>
for warmer weather in the new week and spot gas prices remained relatively<br>
stable.  Meanwhile, off-peak prices were largely stronger due to the<br>
inclusion of the all-day Sunday piece.  According to Weather Derivatives,<br>
heating demand in the WSCC was expected drift lower through the new week,<br>
averaging only 96 percent of normal through February 8.  Additionally, the<br>
latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting mostly normal temperatures<br>
across the Western U.S. from February 7 through 11.  In other industry news,<br>
a federal judge has ordered Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force<br>
to explain the constitutional arguments behind its refusal to release<br>
details of its meetings last year, which included executives from Enron<br>
Corp. and other large energy firms.  The Bush administration has so far<br>
refused to release details such as the names of people it consulted and the<br>
subjects discussed in drafting George W's energy policy.<br>
<br>
Peak power in the Pacific Northwest was little changed for Monday delivery<br>
as forecasted normal temperatures continued to whittle away at heating<br>
demand, though regional demand was expected to remain slightly above normal<br>
through the new week.  While flow forecasts for the Columbia River were<br>
downgraded slightly on Friday, they appeared to be more than ample enough to<br>
satiate regional demand.  Flows at Chief Joseph were forecast to be 75 kcfs<br>
Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 105 kcfs Monday, and 100 kcfs Tuesday through<br>
Friday.  In unit news, Bridger #4 (520 MW) returned to the grid following<br>
repairs to a plugged boiler that began on Wednesday, but Bridger #1 (520 MW)<br>
slipped into the off-line category for tube leak repairs that were expected<br>
to end on Sunday.  The return date for Colstrip #3 (700 MW) was reportedly<br>
pushed back until February 10.  Utah-based Hunter #1 (446 MW) was scheduled<br>
to come down for 24 hours of repairs beginning around midnight on Friday.<br>
On a side note, BPA said Friday that it expects electricity customer McCook<br>
metals to restart partial production at its idled Longview, Washington<br>
aluminum smelter after a new "take-or-pay" contract kicks in on April 1.<br>
Several regional smelters agreed to halt all aluminum production back in<br>
March 2001 due to the electricity supply crunch in the Pacific Northwest.<br>
Several analysts, however, were skeptical as to whether any smelters in the<br>
region would be restarted this year.<br>
<br>
With little change in the generation landscape, flat spot gas prices at the<br>
SoCal border, and normal temperature forecasts for the new week, electricity<br>
prices remained steady in the Golden State on Friday.  Light load prices<br>
appreciated again on Friday, boosted by the all-day Sunday inclusion and<br>
recent trends.  Heavy load pieces at NP15 traded between 24 and 27$/MWh, and<br>
light load deals were done from 21.5 to 23.75$/MWh, picking up by more than<br>
buck on both ends.  In political news, PG&amp;E released the asset and debt<br>
breakdown for its proposed spin-off companies.  In their plan, a generating<br>
company would have $5.3 billion in assets and assume $2.4 billion in debt.<br>
An electric transmission company would be valued at $1.6 billion and take on<br>
$1.1 billion in debt.  Lastly, a gas transmission company would have assets<br>
of $1.4 billion and assume $900 million in debt.  However, U.S. bankruptcy<br>
judge Montali has not yet ruled on PG&amp;E's reorganization plan, and for<br>
fracturing of the utility to move forward, the SEC's approval would also be<br>
required.  In unit news, hydro Big Creek Project PSP (1,020 MW) was only<br>
down 150 MW, while gas-burner Alamitos #5 (480 MW) came off the grid for<br>
planned maintenance.  California weather forecasts called for gradual<br>
warming over the weekend, leading temperatures into just below-normal<br>
territory for the early part of the new week.  Highs for Monday and Tuesday<br>
were expected near 70 degrees in Los Angeles, while northern load centers<br>
anticipated highs near 58 degrees.  The most current six-to-ten called for<br>
normal temperatures from February 7 to 11.<br>
<br>
Peak power prices in the Southwest were largely steady for Monday delivery,<br>
but some late-day selling caused prices to end near session lows.  Heavy<br>
load energy costs at Palo Verde ranged from 23.75 to 25.5$/MWh, with<br>
unconfirmed deals as low as 22$/MWh reported about an hour after the normal<br>
trading session had ended.  "It's still supposed to be cold to start the new<br>
week, but the worst of it is certainly over, or so our in-house forecasters<br>
say," said one Phoenix-based trader.  Some traders believed unit outages<br>
could keep supplies a bit tight to start the new week, but that forecasted<br>
warming would keep most strength at bay.  Coronado #1 (395 MW) had its<br>
return date pushed back once again.  The Arizona-based unit was now sporting<br>
an ETR of 06:30 MST on Saturday, but parties with a share in the unit said<br>
they had not scheduled with it in place.  Meanwhile, Navajo #2 (750 MW) was<br>
set to enter a planned maintenance outage on February 2, with an official<br>
ETR of February 25.<br>

With the return of winter weather and a rash of unit outages, peak power<br>
prices strengthened across the Eastern Interconnect on Friday.  To the<br>
relief of sellers, forecasts called for a dip in temperatures by Saturday.<br>
"Get out and enjoy it, because tomorrow winter is back," recommended one<br>
Philadelphia-based energy dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were<br>
steady on Friday.  March was unmoved, closing at 2.138$/mmBtu, while April<br>
rose less than a cent to end at 2.198$/mmBtu.<br>
<br>
Heavy load electricity prices climbed back into the mid-20s in the<br>
Mid-Atlantic on Friday, on expectations of stronger loads in the new week<br>
and the possibility of a weekend outage.  Western PJM goods for Monday<br>
delivery changed hands between 24.25 and 24.9$/MWh, gaining a robust 3$/MWh<br>
at both ends of the spectrum.  LMPs appreciated on Friday after spending<br>
most of the business day near 30$/MWh, but only averaged 24.47$/MWh.<br>
According to sources, troubled coal-burner Keystone #2 (850 MW) was expected<br>
off-line over the weekend for maintenance.  The unit was down earlier in the<br>
week for unplanned repairs.  Temperatures in the comfortable 60s were<br>
expected to disappear over the weekend.  Monday forecasts called for normal<br>
conditions across PJM, with highs in the low-40s and lows in the low-30s.<br>
The most current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from<br>
February 7 to 11.<br>
<br>
Expectations of early spring maintenance outages and colder weather<br>
forecasts affected the grid on Friday, bolstering the dailies in ECAR.  Into<br>
Cinergy deals were heard between 18 and 20.5$/MWh, firming up 65 cents to a<br>
day ago.  In unit news, Missouri nuke Callaway (1,125 MW) was off-line on<br>
Friday.  Quad Cities #2 (789 MW) was at 95%, powering down for a maintenance<br>
outage expected to last through the end of February.  Sister unit #1 (821<br>
MW) was still off-line early Friday, but expected to return over the<br>
weekend.  Traders continued to keep their ear to the ground, hoping for<br>
information on other upcoming maintenance outages.  Temperatures for the new<br>
week were expected to drop back into the mid-30s across most of ECAR, with<br>
overnight lows in the frosty low-20s.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS<br>
called for above-normal temperatures from February 7 to 11.<br>
<br>
With forecasts finally calling for cold temperatures and a stronger gas<br>
market, peak power prices appreciated in the Southeast on Friday, while<br>
Texas lost ground on little news.  Into Entergy day-ahead pieces were bought<br>
and sold between 19 and 20.5$/MWh, while balance of February traded at a<br>
slight discount around 18.9 to 19.1$/MWh.  ERCOT deals were mostly heard<br>
between 19 and 19.75$/MWh on Friday.  SERC weather was expected to turn cold<br>
with the new week, with overnight lows expected below freezing through<br>
Tuesday.  Texas temperatures were expected to linger in the near-normal<br>
doldrums.  The most current six-to-ten called for above-normal conditions in<br>
Texas and northern SERC and normal temperatures in southern and coastal SERC<br>
from February 7 to 11.<br>

SW Left Out in the Cold<br>
<br>
Peak power prices in the Western U.S. rose for the typically-discounted<br>
Friday/Saturday package on continued strong weather-related demand and<br>
new-month buying.  While temperatures in the Northwest have already begun to<br>
ease, the Southwest was forecast to remain firmly entrenched in heating<br>
demand country through Sunday.  Slightly stronger spot gas prices may also<br>
have lent support to the dailies.  Balance-of-February contracts were still<br>
trading below the dailies, but most players believed spot electricity prices<br>
would fall to meet the balance next week as warmer weather prevails.  In<br>
other industry news, the General Accounting Office (GAO) said Thursday that<br>
it would sue the White House to try to force Vice President Cheney to<br>
release documents detailing contacts between corporate executives and the<br>
administration's energy task force of which Cheney was the chairman.  David<br>
M. Walker, the comptroller general of the United States and director of the<br>
accounting office, said he intended to ask a federal judge to order Mr.<br>
Cheney to give Congress the identities of energy industry executives who<br>
helped the Bush administration formulate a national energy policy last year,<br>
detailing the subject that each executive discussed with task force members.<br>
<br>
The average price paid for day-ahead heavy load energy in the Northwest rose<br>
marginally Thursday on the last remnants of the region's most recent cold<br>
snap, as well as increased demand from the south.  Temperatures had begun to<br>
abate on Thursday, and the region's major load centers were forecast to<br>
return to normal territory by Saturday.  The much-anticipated release of the<br>
February Early Bird Water Supply Forecast from the Northwest River Forecast<br>
Center showed that supplies in the region had risen from the previous report<br>
issued on January 9, but remained mostly below normal on the Columbia and<br>
Snake Rivers.  April through September supply forecasts at The Dalles rose<br>
from 93 to 97 percent, while Grand Coulee gained one percent to 95 percent<br>
for the same period.  "The report may show that water supplies are still<br>
below normal, but there's still plenty of time to beef up these numbers, and<br>
we're already leaps and bounds ahead of where we were at this time last<br>
year," said one Northwest trader.  In unit news, a quasi-official ETR for<br>
Colstrip #3 (700 MW) emerged on Friday, calling for the unit to be back up<br>
between February 5 and 7.  Since we are talking about a Colstrip unit here,<br>
we have opted to err on the side of caution and go with the 7th.<br>
<br>
Despite the expectation of gradually easing temperatures over the weekend,<br>
day-ahead power prices firmed up for the Friday/Saturday package in the<br>
Golden State.  "Gas came up a little and new month jitters had everyone on<br>
edge," joked one California trader about the day's action.  SP15 saw the<br>
most strength, with heavy load deals heard between 24 and 27.45$/MWh.<br>
Similarly, NP15 peak goods changed hands from 24 to 27$/MWh, with the bulk<br>
of transactions in the 25 to 26$/MWh range.  Traders said BOM was, not<br>
unexpectedly, still trading at a discount to the dailies.  In political<br>
news, Governor Davis formally requested a FERC investigation into alleged<br>
price manipulation by Enron last summer.  Specifically, the Governor accused<br>
Enron of pushing prices up on long-term contracts.  The CPUC reached an<br>
agreement with the DWR, which would allow the department to issue bonds to<br>
repay the California general fund for power purchases it has made.  To date<br>
the DWR has bought $10 billion worth of electricity, and expects that total<br>
to reach $18 billion by the end of the year.   On the generation front,<br>
Alamitos #4 (320 MW) joined off-line sister units #3 and #6 off-line on<br>
Thursday.  Smaller units Huntington Beach #3 (225 MW) and Southbay #4 (222<br>
MW) also exited the grid for unplanned and planned maintenance,<br>
respectively.  Friday and Saturday forecasts called for highs to linger in<br>
the low-50s mid-state and the low-60s in the south, with overnight lows<br>
expected to be in the chilly 34 to 41 degree range.  Predictions for the new<br>
week called for near-normal conditions, and the latest six-to-ten called for<br>
normal temperatures from February 6 to 10.<br>
<br>
As Phoenix residents continued to bask in overnight temperatures in the<br>
mid-30s, peak power prices continued to rise for the Friday/Saturday combo.<br>
Temperatures were forecast to start warming up beginning on Sunday,<br>
prompting traders to expect falling loads and prices next week.  Peak power<br>
at Palo Verde ranged from 23.5 to 26.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals going<br>
through at the 25$/MWh mark.  Light load goods at the Southwest hub gained<br>
as much as 2.5$/MWh with confirmed transactions anywhere between 16.75 and<br>
19.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) was still having trouble<br>
returning from a January 25 tube leak outage, but sources familiar with the<br>
Arizona-based unit were confident that it would begin to ramp up at 06:00<br>
MST on Friday (though they weren't willing to put money on it).  The latest<br>
six-to-ten from the NWS continued to call for normal temperatures to blanket<br>
the desert region from February 6 through 10.<br>

With the return of ice storms in the Midwest and generally winter-like<br>
conditions to the entire East, peak power prices strengthened on Thursday.<br>
"Prices would have risen even more today, but recent bearish trends have<br>
prompted a wait-and-see attitude among traders," commented one Cinergy<br>
dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures rose on Thursday.  March gained<br>
5.8 cents to close at 2.138$/mmBtu, while April climbed 4.3 cents to end at<br>
2.19$/mmBtu.<br>
<br>
Expectations of colder weather in the Mid-Atlantic sent day-ahead<br>
electricity prices higher on Thursday.  Western PJM goods changed hands<br>
between 21.7 and 22$/MWh, while early deals for Monday delivery were heard<br>
at 24.25$/MWh.  Traders said fewer Cinergy imports and more New York exports<br>
were the real movers on Thursday.  Forecasts called for little change on<br>
Friday, but substantial cooling over the weekend and into the new week.  The<br>
most current six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal temperatures<br>
for most of PJM and normal conditions along coast from February 6 to 10.<br>
<br>
Amid cold weather and winter storms, heavy load energy costs jumped up in<br>
the Midwest on Thursday.  Into Cinergy pieces for Friday were bought and<br>
sold between 17.5 and 19.85$/MWh.  "We only saw two trades below 19$/MWh<br>
today, and most of our volume went through very close to the high end,"<br>
commented one market player, an explanation echoed by most Cinergy traders<br>
on Thursday.  Talk also centered on the new MidwestISO that will take over<br>
transmission responsibilities on Friday.  Pointing to studies by the Edison<br>
Institute and others, most traders thought any changes to the market would<br>
happen gradually, and didn't expect any immediate affects on prices.  "The<br>
new rules will focus on generators for now," said one calm ECAR scheduler.<br>
Next week deals also rose on Thursday, and were heard mostly between 20.15<br>
and 20.35$/MWh.  "The near term was modestly stronger today," summed up one<br>
trader.  In unit news, Rockport (1,300 MW) was reportedly off-line for early<br>
spring maintenance.  Also of note, ECAR load estimates were up from<br>
approximately 31,000 for Friday to 34,000 for Monday.  Colder conditions<br>
finally rolled into ECAR, with forecasts for Friday calling for temperatures<br>
in the low-30s to mid-40s across most of the region.  The mercury was<br>
expected to dip more in the new week, and the latest six-to-ten predicted<br>
mostly above-normal temperatures from February 6 to 10.<br>
<br>
Anticipation of a break in the bearish warm weather and rumors of units<br>
coming off for early spring maintenance lent support to SERC and ERCOT spot<br>
prices.  Into Entergy deals were heard between 17.6 and 20.25$/MWh, with<br>
prices Into TVA and ERCOT also breaking into the 20s.  Strength in the<br>
natural gas markets also cheered traders on Thursday.  Texas temperatures<br>
took a dive on Thursday, with the cold front expected to spread into SERC<br>
over the weekend.  The updated six-to-ten called for mostly normal<br>
temperatures across SERC and Texas from February 6 to 10.<br>

Going Short for the Shortest Month<br>
<br>
Day-ahead electricity prices in the Western U.S. were mostly higher<br>
Wednesday on continued cold weather.  Some traders also said that rising<br>
spot gas prices lent support to the daily power market.  "The worst of this<br>
cold snap appears to be over, but the market will likely take a day or so to<br>
react," believed one marketer.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating<br>
demand throughout the West was forecast to fall to below-normal levels over<br>
the coming weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for<br>
mostly normal temperatures from February 5 through 9.  February contracts<br>
were trading a buck or two below the dailies at all of the major Western<br>
hubs on Wednesday.  "Historically, February has been a lighter load month<br>
than January, and that's why we're heading into the new month with a short<br>
position," said one matter-of-fact trader.  In other industry news,<br>
Wednesday's AGA inventory report showed that U.S. gas stocks fell 111 bcf<br>
last week, right in line with most industry estimates.  Total U.S.<br>
inventories of 2.294 tcf were still 1.053 tcf, or 85 percent, above last<br>
year.  Of the 111 bcf taken out of storage last week, 19 were drawn in the<br>
Western Consuming region.  Total inventories in the West stood at 360 bcf,<br>
or 71 percent of full.  Western stocks were at 222 bcf the same week a year<br>
ago, and have averaged 265 bcf over the past five years.<br>
<br>
Peak power prices in the Northwest rose marginally for Thursday delivery,<br>
despite a general sense that the worst of the cold snap was over.  "We were<br>
a little surprised to see prices rise today because it is supposed to begin<br>
warming up, and we are fairly bearish heading into February," said one<br>
Washington-based trader.  Heating demand in the region was forecast to<br>
steadily drop from 119 percent of normal on Thursday, to 99 percent of<br>
normal on February 6.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward<br>
again on Wednesday, coming in at 115 kcfs Thursday, 110 kcfs Friday, 80 kcfs<br>
Saturday, 65 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs Monday and Tuesday, and 105 kcfs next<br>
Wednesday.  In unit news, Bridger #4 (520 MW) was shut Wednesday morning due<br>
to a plugged boiler.  While no ETR was given for the Wyoming-based unit,<br>
sources familiar with thermal plants said such a problem is usually fixed in<br>
48 hours or less.  While Colstrip #3 (700 MW) remained down with no official<br>
ETR, some parties believed it would not return until February 9.<br>
<br>
Amid continued below-normal forecasts for Thursday and stronger natural gas<br>
values at the SoCal border, day-ahead electricity prices for delivery on the<br>
last day of January gained ground in the Golden State.  Traders noted that<br>
spot gas and light load prices were particularly strong.  "I was surprised<br>
that gas was strong today.  The forecasts are warming gradually though, so<br>
gas should start to ease soon and electricity prices should fall off," said<br>
one California trader.  Prices at COB settled higher on Wednesday, with<br>
heavy load deals heard between 21.25 and 22.95$/MWh and light load changing<br>
hands from 18 to 19.5.  "We saw an opportunity to make some money at COB<br>
today," said one Western dealer.  February COB lingered about 2$/MWh cheaper<br>
than the dailies, with peak products heard trading near 20$/MWh and off-peak<br>
pieces reportedly going through from 16.75 to 16.95$/MWh.  Similarly,<br>
front-month deals at NP15 were heard about a dollar cheaper than the<br>
dailies, near 22.75$/MWh for heavy load goods.  CAISO reported little change<br>
in the overall generation landscape on Wednesday, with a difference of less<br>
than 100 MW off-line to a day ago.  Of note, San Luis (326 MW) exited the<br>
grid for planned maintenance.  Thursday temperatures were expected to reach<br>
highs in the low-60s at southern load centers, and about 50 degrees at<br>
mid-state.  The five-day forecast called for gradual warming, with<br>
temperatures still expected to be about four degrees below normal on Sunday.<br>
The most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from February 5 to<br>
9.<br>
<br>
While peak power prices in the Southwest dipped by 50 cents on both the high<br>
and low ends, the bulk of deals were done at slightly higher levels than on<br>
the previous day.  Continued cold weather and rising spot gas values were<br>
the main factors lending support to the dailies on Wednesday.  Starting on<br>
Friday, heating demand in the desert region was forecast to drop sharply,<br>
dipping to below-normal levels by February 3.  Peak electricity prices at<br>
Palo Verde ranged from 23$/MWh early, to a late-session high of 26$/MWh,<br>
while February contracts were heard around the 21.65$/MWh mark.  Light load<br>
goods for Thursday delivery traded from 14.75 to 17$/MWh, while February off<br>
peak was seeing action near the 14.7$/MWh level.  There were no new outages<br>
of consequence to report in the Southwest on Wednesday, but looking further<br>
ahead, Palo Verde #2 (1,270 MW) was scheduled to shut for spring maintenance<br>
from March 16 through April 20.  Weather forecasts called for gradual<br>
warming over the coming weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was<br>
predicting normal temperatures from February 5 through 9.<br>

Amid expectations of continued warm weather through Friday and a natural gas<br>
storage report within industry estimates, spot electricity prices were<br>
mostly steady across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday.  Saturday<br>
predictions called for below-normal temperatures, a break in the bearish<br>
weather pattern that has been depressing demand and prices for much of<br>
January.  The AGA weekly natural gas storage report listed a draw of 111<br>
bcf.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were mixed, with March picking up<br>
1.3 cents to close at 2.08$/mmBtu, while April slipped 0.3 cent to end the<br>
day at 2.147$/mmBtu.<br>
<br>
While revised loads and forecasts met with skepticism from traders in the<br>
Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday, day-ahead electricity prices climbed slightly<br>
higher.  "Loads and temperatures were revised upwards today.  There's<br>
supposed to be some colder weather for the weekend, but bullish forecasts<br>
have been pushed back all month, so we'll see if the cold actually<br>
materializes this time," commented one PJM player with a wait-and-see<br>
attitude.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery changed hands between<br>
21.2 and 22.2$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done around 21.6$/MWh.  LMPs<br>
gradually increased from 09:00 through 11:30 EST reaching a high of 44$/MWh,<br>
but averaged only 20.17$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  In unit news, sources said<br>
Keystone #2 (850 MW) returned to the grid on Wednesday, back from a two-day<br>
maintenance outage.  High temperatures were expected in the upper-40s to<br>
low-50s on Thursday, with overnight lows in the 35 to 42-degree range.  The<br>
latest six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 5 to 9.<br>
<br>
Peak power prices settled lower in the Midwest on Thursday, as continued<br>
bearish fundamentals took their toll on the ECAR market.  Into Cinergy<br>
pieces were bought and sold between 16 and 18.5$/MWh, with the low end<br>
reached in late trade.  No new outages were reported on Thursday, although<br>
traders continued to speculate that many marginal units were off-line for<br>
load following.  Temperatures were predicted to be slightly warmer on<br>
Thursday.  However, the mercury was expected to drop about 15 degrees on<br>
Friday.  The most current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures<br>
from February 5 to 9.<br>
<br>
With stronger than expected natural gas values, heavy load energy costs<br>
edged higher in the Southeast on Thursday.  "Prices were bouncing around<br>
quite a bit today.  It was hard to figure out where things were," commented<br>
one Entergy dealer.  Other sources said spring maintenance would start to<br>
affect the market soon, as operators push repairs forward in light of low<br>
prices and warm weather.  Into Entergy trades were heard between 16 and<br>
17.5$/MWh, mostly in the 16s, while February changed hands from 18.35 to<br>
18.5$/MWh.  Texas power remained steady, firming up a buck on the low end.<br>
The bulk of Into TVA deals were done with a 17 handle, but early trades were<br>
heard as low as 16$/MWh.  The updated six-to-ten called for mostly normal<br>
conditions in SERC and Texas from February 5 to 9.<br>
