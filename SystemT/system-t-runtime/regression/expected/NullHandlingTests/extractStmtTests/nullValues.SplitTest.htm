to say "hi".  I'm really serious.  I actually have really great neighbors in<br>

people.<br>
<br>
I don't know what </b></font><font color = gray>]</font>Brendan<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b> has told you about me but here's the story.  I was<br>
born and raised in New Mexico and hate it here!  I need trees and green!<br>
Someone once compared landing in New Mexico to landing in a litter box.<br>
Where there's not dirt there's piles of crap.  Now everytime a plane flies<br>
me back home I look around and agree.<br>
<br>
So, to say the least I'm a little stir crazy for a new environment.  The<br>
first part of August I will be moving to Newport Beach, California.  Or one<br>
of four other beach communities in that area.  I want to experience that<br>
whole lifestyle for at least a year.  Then I'm moving to Oregon.  I've never<br>
visited or anything I'm just drawn there.  To be perfectly honest it's<br>
because of the two movies "Goonies" and "Kindergarten Cop".  I loved those<br>
movies as a kid and have wanted to move to Astoria ever since.  Now's my<br>
chance.  I just finished college and have a period of resting time before I<br>
go after my master's in Public Health Administration or my MBA.  We'll see<br>
which fits me best later.  I don't feel that at 24 I can really decide the<br>
"best" avenue for the next 50 years of my career so I'm waiting for the life<br>
experience to kick in and lead the way later.<br>
<br>
As of yet I have no set plans as to dates, iteneraries, etc and so forth.<br>
I'm a very spontaneous type of person I don't really "do" planning and<br>
scheduling.  I just kind of show up and try to make my own fun.  It's better<br>
that way.  Life can be too organized!<br>
<br>
Well now that I've given you a "short" introduction...haha.  I'd love to<br>
hear back from you about any conflicting dates that you might have in July.<br>
Don't worry if they change I won't hold ya to them.  The only time that I am<br>
forecasting for myself is the 12th through the 16th (of July) IF I don't go<br>
to Calgary, Canada.  Currently I'm planning as many trips as I possibly can.<br>
My youth is fading fast and I need to enjoy as much of it as I possible<br>
while I don't have a husband and kids to take care of. :)<br>
<br>
Hope to hear from you soon!<br>

Thank you so much for writing back to me. I have been missing you like crazy without any way of getting in touch with you.  How are things going?  We have so much catching up to do.  I realize more than ever what a special friend you are and how much I have missed our conversations.  I hope all is going wonderful with you.  Things here are great.  I am almost done with my second year of school (only 2 more weeks)  I just took a comprehensive exam over the last 2 years and I think I passed.  I am constantly amazed that I am almost done with school and will soon be practicing medicine on poor innocent people.  I'll actually be in Seattle all of August and September, so hopefully we can arrange some kind of meeting so I can give you a big hug.<br>
How is work?  Are you still doing the same job?  I know last time we talked you had all kinds of crazy ideas floating around about moving to Europe or Japan or something crazy like that.  In fact, that is what I thought had happened and I was so scared that i would not be able to find you.  Do you still have your wonderful motorcycle?  I know you were moving to a new home the last time we talked, but I know nothing about it.  are you living by yourself, in a condo, a home, an apartment?  Anything else wild and crazy that I have missed hearing about?  I'm sure there is....<br>
Well, I just had to check something quickly off the internet before class today, and unfortunately I must go.  But it was wonderful to see your name and hear that you are alive and well.  I will definately be calling you this week to catch up.<br>
I have missed you my friend, take care,<br>

<br>
Going forward we will be transacting with Enron Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis.  We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for non-firm energy trades.  Enron Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possibilities for export and import.  We should be familiar with the Alberta Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD.  The lead or NW trader will provide Enron Canada with their estimate or feel of the market each morning and throughout the day.<br>
<br>
Enron Canada will be trying to obtain non-firm transmission nearly every hour.  WE need to tell them if this is an unwise practice from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, as they will lose around $7 per mw (CDD) on unused transmission with zero chance for return.<br>
<br>
Further, Enron Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.  They will give us the first look, but if we cannot use their energy, they will contact WWP, IPC, TransAlta or other counterparty in an attempt to recoup some of their loss.  I do not see a need for this and I think it leaves us open to tainted customer relationships, financial loss, and embarrassment.  If we are in contact with Enron Canada before the fact (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.  Be very clear in your dealings with NW counterparties that you are buying or selling a non-firm product.  Determine a book-out price to solve problems with physical flow if necessary.  We are basically buying a put or a call and should pay our counterparty appropriately.<br>
<br>
Finally, I would like to see improved communication with Enron Canada.  It appears we have limited our contacts within our own company and hindered the flow of information to both parties' detriment.  I feel we can do better.  I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Enron Canada and Enron North America.  This is counterproductive for both parties for obvious reasons.  Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with Enron Canada.  This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that can only be beneficial.  If you have questions or ideas regarding our relationship with Enron Canada, please let me know.<br>

Enron Global LNG<br>
Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world's growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels.   Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for Enron's wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market.<br>

IN THE NEWS<br>
<br>
Enron Corp. Says First-Quarter Profit Rose 20 Percent<br>
Houston, April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent as sales almost quadrupled. Profit from operations rose to $406 million, or 47 cents, from $338 million, or 40 cents, in the year-earlier period.  Enron raised its 2001 profit forecast to $1.75 to $1.80 a share, from its January projection of $1.70 to $1.75.<br>
<br>
First-quarter revenue surged to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion as Enron boosted the volume of power sold in North America by 90 percent. Enron had a first-quarter gain of $19 million, or 2 cents a share, for an accounting change, making net income $425 million, or 49 cents a share. There were no charges or gains in the year-earlier period.<br>

Course Description<br>
This course builds on our Applied Energy Derivatives program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective.  Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring / marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.  Applied Energy Derivatives, or its equivalent is a prerequisite for this program; no other advanced preparation is required.  CPE Credits: Accounting &amp; Auditing 2; Consulting Services 1; Management 1; Specialized Knowledge &amp; Applications 12.<br>
<br>
At the conclusion of this course, participants will be able to:<br>
Decipher the role of the price curve, volatility, and time in determining the intrinsic value and time value of an option premium<br>
Understand how a dealer 'trades volatility' and dynamically hedges an option<br>
Recognize the limitations of traditional option pricing models when applied to energy<br>
Annualize a periodic (e.g. monthly) volatility and vice versa<br>
Create synthetic puts and calls using put-call parity to exploit mispriced options<br>
Incorporate volatility term structures, "smiles and skews", in analyzing deals<br>
Establish a delta-neutral hedge of an option and calculate the cost of changing prices on that hedge position<br>
Comprehend the relationship between gamma and actual price volatility and its consequent implications for a dealer's earnings<br>
Anticipate the irregular changes in gamma by stress testing option portfolios, thereby allowing more informed position management<br>
Interpret an aggregated risk management report for an option portfolio and the positive or negative values for delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho<br>
Structure an option on a swap to create innovative hedges for customers<br>
Create extendable and cancelable fixed price deals<br>
Embed a swaption sale to create sub-index physical supply to a user<br>
Compare the merits and earnings opportunities among various alternatives available to a customer seeking to reverse an existing swap position<br>
Determine the cash value of a swap terminated before its end date<br>
Apply swaps with off-market fixed prices to monetize value in existing contracts or to provide for the cash/borrowing needs of a customer<br>
Combine off-market swaps in complex structures: e.g. "blend-and-extend"</b></font><font color = gray>]</font>

Time:		8:00 am to 5:00 pm<br>
<br>
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today.  An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.<br>

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:<br>
<br>
Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.<br>
Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines that are characteristic of energy prices.<br>
Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and transportation.<br>
Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.<br>
Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of price curves and their components.<br>
Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship between basis and transportation/transmission.<br>
Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.<br>
Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing.<br>
Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.<br>
Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.<br>
Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.<br>
Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using embedded options.<br>
Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum prices, etc.</b></font><font color = gray>]</font>

DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?<br>
Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS<br>
By </b></font><font color = gray>]</font>Emily<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b> Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas<br>
Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN &lt;http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&amp;d=t&gt; - news &lt;http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html&gt;) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS &lt;http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&amp;d=t&gt; - news &lt;http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html&gt;) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money.<br>
The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?''].<br>
Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder.<br>
CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business.<br>
Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg.<br>
For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron.<br>
``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli.<br>
That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO </b></font><font color = gray>]</font>John<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b> Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.''<br>
Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons &amp; Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.''<br>
Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron? Don't bet the chalet on it.<br>

Take the Money and Run<br>
<br>
Peak power prices for Wednesday delivery were mostly steady across the West<br>
on Tuesday, largely due to a stagnant spot gas market and near-normal<br>
temperatures.  "Prices were trading in very narrow ranges at most of the<br>
hubs today, and that made for a lackluster session," complained one<br>
marketer.  NYMEX Henry Hub contracts for the front months closed lower on<br>
Tuesday despite cold Northeast temperatures, likely due to more moderate<br>
forecasts for next week, and on some technical selling.  March slipped 4.3<br>
cents to close at 2.074$/mmBtu, while April shed 3.2 cents to end at<br>
2.152$/mmBtu.  Most 2003 and 2004 contracts finished up slightly.  The EIA<br>
recently said that it expects U.S. natural gas inventories to end the first<br>
quarter at a record 1.46 tcf.  The low point for U.S. gas stocks at the end<br>
of the winter heating season has averaged about 920 bcf over the past eight<br>
years.  Weekly draws of 144 bcf would be needed over the nine remaining<br>
weeks of withdrawl season to lower inventories to a more normal 1.0 tcf.<br>
Not a likely scenario since draws for the nine-week period have averaged 63<br>
bcf over the past five years.  In other industry news, lawyers for </b></font><font color = gray>]</font>Ken<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b> Lay<br>
have refused to accept a subpoena from a congressional committee requiring<br>
his appearance at public hearings.  Mr. Lay's lawyers said they did not know<br>
their client's whereabouts and could not accept any subpoenas on his behalf.<br>
Peggy Peterson, a spokesperson for the House financial services committee<br>
said, "He [Lay's lawyer] tells us he does not know of Lay's whereabouts,<br>
which we find quite puzzling to say the least.  Even if Lay is forced to<br>
appear by a subpoena, many parties believe he would likely plead the Fifth<br>
and not testify.<br>
<br>
Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were steady to slightly higher than<br>
levels reported a day ago.  Amid continuing cold overnight temperatures,<br>
light load goods traded slightly higher, and in a narrower range.  Flow<br>
forecasts for Chief Joseph were little changed, coming in at 110 kcfs<br>
Wednesday and Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday,<br>
115 kcfs Monday, and 110 kcfs next Tuesday.  No news was good news on the<br>
unit front Tuesday, with no new significant outages reported.  According to<br>
Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was forecast to average<br>
115 percent of normal through February 12, with the greatest demand expected<br>
during the latter part of that period.<br>
<br>
With little news, close-to-normal temperatures, and steady spot gas prices<br>
at the SoCal border, day-ahead electricity prices edged up slightly in the<br>
Golden State on Tuesday.  Heavy load transactions at NP15 went through from<br>
24.25 up to 26.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done in the 24.25 to<br>
24.75$/MWh range and the high end reached late.  Light load goods maintained<br>
their recent strength, trading from 20.25 to 21.5$/MWh.  NP15<br>
balance-of-February saw action around 22.75 to 23.25$/MWh.  "I think some<br>
traders had the March jitters, light and heavy firmed up some there today,"<br>
commented one California player.  SP15 off-peak saw the most strength on<br>
Tuesday, with deals going through as high as 22.95$/MWh for Wednesday<br>
delivery.  There was little change in the generation landscape on Tuesday.<br>
Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) returned to service from a maintenance outage that<br>
began February 2.  Alamitos #3 (320 MW) ramped up to 240 MW, on its way back<br>
from an outage that began January 26.  Forecasts for Wednesday called for<br>
highs at southern load centers to reach the mid-60s, down slightly from<br>
Tuesday's levels, with overnight lows in the upper-40s.  The state capital<br>
anticipated a high of 58 degrees and a low of 36 degrees.  The most current<br>
six-to-ten from the NWS predicted normal temperatures from February 11 to<br>
15.<br>
<br>
In the Southwest, peak power prices for Tuesday delivery were flat to<br>
slightly lower to a day ago as weather conditions in cities such as Phoenix<br>
were described as "beautiful, sunny, and in the 70s."  Heavy load energy at<br>
Palo Verde ranged from 22.5 to 23.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed trades heard as<br>
high as 24$/MW.  Mead commanded a premium to PV, but most of that energy was<br>
reportedly bound for the Golden State.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (395 MW)<br>
returned to full power Tuesday, following tube leak repairs that began back<br>
on January 25.  Meanwhile, Coronado #2 (385 MW) slipped into a planned<br>
maintenance outage slated to last until February 10.  Weather Derivatives<br>
forecast heating demand in the desert region to average a mere 85 percent of<br>
normal through February 10, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was<br>
calling for mostly normal temperatures from February 11 through 15.<br>

Amid cold temperature forecasts, particularly in SERC, peak power prices<br>
rose across the Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday.  "It was good to see some<br>
strength in the dailies, however short-lived it may be," said one Cinergy<br>
player.  Firmer prices were seen in Balance-of-February and the March/April<br>
contracts as well, despite another lackluster day in gas.  NYMEX Henry Hub<br>
futures edged down again on Tuesday.  March fell 4.3 cents to close at<br>
2.074$/mmBtu, while April lost 3.2 cents to end at 2.152$/mmBtu.<br>
<br>
Amid much higher real-time prices, peak electricity prices edged up just<br>
slightly in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.  Western PJM goods for Wednesday<br>
delivery were bought and sold between 24.75 and 25.75$/MWh.  Traders mostly<br>
expected prices to drop off with warmer forecasts for the end of the week.<br>
LMPs reached a lofty high of 115$/MWh early Tuesday morning, but averaged<br>
35.09$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures were expected to warm into<br>
the mid-40s on Wednesday and continue there through Saturday.  The latest<br>
six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 11 to 15.<br>
<br>
With unit outages and winter weather, heavy load energy costs made robust<br>
gains in the Midwest on Tuesday, to the delight of sellers.  "People have<br>
really found their faith today.  Balance-of-Feb was up over a buck and<br>
March/April surged a bit as well," crowed one trader.  Into Cinergy edged up<br>
all day, trading between 22.75 and 26$/MWh, while Balance was heard from<br>
21.1 to 21.35$/MWh and March/April saw action up to 21.25$/MWh.  Power<br>
sellers were concerned with the higher transmission rates they were seeing<br>
from the newly operating MidwestISO on Tuesday.  "I'm seeing a base rate of<br>
4$/MWh, and if you add in ancillary costs of 50 cents and recovery of old<br>
costs at 2.5$/MWh, transmission is costing nearly 7$/MWh, compared to about<br>
4$/MWh before.  That's going to hamper movement in and out of Cinergy, and<br>
increase volatility in the market," predicted one in-the-know seller.  In<br>
unit news, sources said Beaver Valley #2 (833 MW) has been off-line since<br>
February 4.  Traders also said Cook #2 could be back as early as February<br>
16, while the Rockport unit (1,300 MW) was expected to remain down into<br>
mid-March.  High temperatures were predicted to warm slightly into the<br>
upper-30s for Wednesday, and the most current six-to-ten continued to<br>
forecast above-normal temperatures from February 11 to 15.<br>
<br>
Bullish weather conditions sent day-ahead electricity prices higher in the<br>
Southeast and Texas on Tuesday.  "I saw some buyers today that have been out<br>
of the market for a while," commented one SERC player.  Into TVA on-peak<br>
pieces traded from 23 to 25$/MWh, with off-peak pieces equally strong from<br>
16 to 19$/MWh.  Unlike northern hubs, Entergy dealers reported a weaker<br>
balance-of-the-month market on Tuesday.  Wednesday forecasts called for well<br>
below-normal temperatures across SERC and Texas, with highs mostly in the<br>
mid-30s to mid-40s.  The mercury was expected to climb into normal territory<br>
by Saturday and the up-to-date six-to-ten predicted above-normal<br>
temperatures from February 11 to 15.<br>

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery were slightly lower across the<br>
Western U.S. on Monday, unquestionably the result of less weather-related<br>
demand.  "Temperatures are forecast to be normal to slightly above-normal<br>
through the week in most regions, so we're feeling pretty bearish right<br>
now," commented one marketer.  A late-session rally for off peak power was<br>
reported at the Mid-Columbia, but most players believed that one or two<br>
parties must have been caught a little bit short given the mild weather and<br>
abundant supplies.  Heating demand in the WSCC was only expected to average<br>
94 percent of normal through February 11, and the latest six-to-ten-day<br>
forecast was calling for mostly normal temperatures from February 10 through<br>
14.  In other industry news, former Enron CEO </b></font><font color = gray>]</font>Ken<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b> Lay told Congress on<br>
Sunday that he would refuse to testify before two committees preparing to<br>
hear his testimony.  As a result, the Senate Commerce Committee cancelled<br>
Monday's hearing at which Mr. Lay was to have been the sole witness.  The<br>
Senate Commerce Committee said it would meet Tuesday morning to subpoena Mr.<br>
Lay.  Senator Byron Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrat who heads the<br>
committee's consumer affairs subcommittee, said, "We decided that we really<br>
had no choice but to issue a subpoena to require his attendance."  Mr.<br>
Dorgan said he had been assured by some Republicans on the Commerce<br>
Committee that they would vote in favor of a subpoena.<br>
<br>
Tuesday's heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell slightly from levels<br>
seen for Monday as regional temperatures had begun to moderate.  A late-day<br>
rally occurred in the light load arena when some shorts reportedly entered<br>
the market.  "There wasn't a whole lot of activity for the off peak when the<br>
session began, but later on it just shot up," said one Oregon-based utility<br>
trader.  Heating demand in the region was forecast to pick up over the<br>
coming weekend, rising to an average of 121 percent of normal next Sunday<br>
and Monday.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward on Monday,<br>
coming in at 110 kcfs through Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday,<br>
60 kcfs Sunday, and 115 kcfs next Monday.  There were a few goings on in the<br>
generation landscape Monday.  Bridger #1 (520 MW) was back in service, but<br>
Bridger #3 and #4 (520 MW each) were brought down so engineers could perform<br>
some "boiler unplugging."  The Wyoming-based units were both expected to<br>
return to service sometime on Thursday.<br>
<br>
Amid stagnant gas values and slightly below-normal temperatures, power<br>
prices settled lower in the Golden State on Monday.  "I think prices will<br>
trend down this week, with the warmer weather," commented one California<br>
player.  Heavy load goods at NP15 changed hands between 24 and 24.75$/MWh,<br>
with unconfirmed trades heard as high as 26$/MWh.  Light load pieces were<br>
bought and sold from 19.75 to 21$/MWh.  NP15 Balance-of-February was heard<br>
near 23.25$/MWh.  Of hydroelectric interest, the California DWR listed<br>
snow-water equivalents in the northern section of the state at 111% of<br>
normal.  Spot gas values at the Socal border remained flat to Friday levels,<br>
between 2.13 and 2.18/$mmBtu.  In unit news, gas-fired Alamitos #4 (480 MW)<br>
returned to the grid on Monday, and Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) went down for<br>
planned maintenance on Saturday.  On the weather front, Tuesday forecasts<br>
called for highs to reach 70 degrees in L.A. and 58 to 61 degrees at<br>
mid-state load centers.  Overnight lows were anticipated in the mid-30s to<br>
mid-40s.  The five-day outlook predicted little change through Friday.  The<br>
most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from February 10 to<br>
14.<br>
<br>
With Phoenix forecast to see daytime highs in the 70s and overnight lows in<br>
the 50s through the week, day-ahead electricity prices headed lower in the<br>
Southwest on Monday.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 23 to 24.25$/MWh<br>
an average decline of 1$/MWh from levels reported for Monday.  Mead<br>
commanded a premium to PV, with several players stating that the<br>
higher-priced electricity was bound for the California market.  In unit<br>
news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) was operating at 260 megawatts on Monday, but was<br>
still having trouble ramping all the way to full power.  Meanwhile, Coronado<br>
#2 (385 MW) was scheduled to come down early Tuesday for some planned<br>
maintenance slated to last until February 10.  The latest six-to-ten from<br>
the NWS was calling for above-normal temperatures in eastern New Mexico and<br>
normal temperatures everywhere else from February 10 through 14.<br>

As the expected colder temperatures materialized across the Eastern<br>
Interconnect, peak power prices appreciated on Monday.  With the exception<br>
of Texas, which tanked on low gas values, heavy load goods changed hands<br>
firmly in the 20s everywhere.  Maintenance outages also contributed to the<br>
bullish tenor of the day.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures slipped on<br>
Monday, with March falling 2.1 cents to close at 2.117$/mmBtu.  April also<br>
edged down a comparatively mild 1.4 cents to end at 2.184$/mmBtu.<br>
<br>
Amid much stronger load forecasts and colder temperatures expected for<br>
Tuesday, heavy load energy costs rose in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.<br>
Western PJM pieces were bought and sold in a narrow range from 24.9 to<br>
25.3$/MWh.  LMPs bounced up and down three times in the late morning and<br>
early afternoon on Monday, and averaged 22.38$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  On<br>
the generation front, sources gave Keystone #2 (850 MW) a revised expected<br>
off-line date of February 8.  The unit was reportedly slated to undergo 20<br>
days of maintenance.  High temperatures were expected in the upper-30s on<br>
Tuesday, and predicted in the low-40s by the end of the workweek.  The most<br>
current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 10 to<br>
14.<br>
<br>
Traders in the Midwest characterized the dailies as a "wild ride" on Monday,<br>
with heavy load electricity prices strengthening considerably on the<br>
aggregate.  "Cinergy opened near 20, climbed to 22.5, came off, and leapt up<br>
all the way to 24$/MWh at the end," said one Cinergy commentator on the day<br>
after the Super Bowl.  While the dailies changed hands from 20 to 24$/MWh on<br>
Monday, market players said the bulk of deals were seen around 21.5$/MWh.<br>
Balance-of-February trades were heard between 20.25 and 20.5$/MWh.  In unit<br>
news, Quad Cities #2 (789 MW) was off the grid for refueling and pump<br>
repairs on Monday, with a tentative ETR of March 11.  Sister unit #1 (821<br>
MW) was in start-up.  Fellow nuke LaSalle (1,144 MW) was also in start-up at<br>
25% late Monday, and expected at full by mid-week.   Temperatures were<br>
slightly colder than anticipated by Friday forecasts, with highs across ECAR<br>
in the mid-30s and lows in the low-20s.  The outlook called for slight<br>
warming, into the low-40s by Thursday, and the latest six-to-ten called for<br>
above-normal temperatures from February 10 to 14.<br>
<br>
The Southeast saw some strength on Monday as daily power prices responded to<br>
the colder forecasts.  Into TVA day-ahead peak power prices were heard from<br>
21 to 24$/MWh, with the low end reached late and the bulk of deals done in<br>
the 22 to 22.25$/MWh range, according to traders.  Balance contracts into<br>
TVA were heard trading between 20 and 20.15$/MWh.  Texas electricity prices<br>
weakened on gas, with transactions heard between 18.5 and 19.35$/MWh.  ERCOT<br>
balance-of-the-month saw action mostly from 18 to 18.6$/MWh.  Tuesday<br>
forecasts called for temperatures well below normal across both regions,<br>
with highs expected in the mid-40s.  SERC lows were forecast to drop into<br>
the low-20s.  The most up-to-date six-to-ten predicted above-normal<br>
temperatures from February 10 to 14.<br>

For yet another day we seem to be having problems including all the schedules in our EPE schedule sheet.  Tag 52159 was not included (25mw schedule to LADWP).  I think part of the problem is some counterparties are not including EPMIWE as a PSE.  Fortunately, the dispatchers had the schedule and informed me of the problem.  I then called LADWP and WESCO to checkout with them.  If this did not happen we wouldn't have known what the deal was.<br>

Additionally, you are encouraged to recruit solid skill players for the team.  Especially at the beginning of the season, more players is better, and fresh blood is always a way to build the team.<br>

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest =<br>
of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is no=<br>
t entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=<br>
oks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two prima=<br>
ry initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.=<br>
The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already=<br>
well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effor=<br>
t together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been =<br>
ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power co=<br>
mmodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=<br>
People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Ric=<br>
hter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to=<br>
get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend ta=<br>
lking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to =<br>
several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I =<br>
am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate=<br>
the power procurement and delivery efforts.<br>
<br>
As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron =<br>
has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be loca=<br>
ted on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hop=<br>
e to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within=<br>
the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.<br>
<br>
The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=<br>
dle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on=<br>
or about February 6th.<br>
<br>

over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enr=<br>

<br>
As per our conversation today, I am sending you an outline of what we intend to be doing in Ercot and in particular on the real-time desk. For 2002 Ercot is split into 4 zones with TCRs between 3 of the zones. The zones are fairly diverse from a supply/demand perspective. Ercot has an average load of 38,000 MW, a peak of 57,000 MW with a breakdown of 30% industrial, 30% commercial and 40% residential. There are already several successful aggregators that are looking to pass on their wholesale risk to a credit-worthy QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity).<br>
<br>
Our expectation is that we will be a fully qualified QSE by mid-March with the APX covering us up to that point. Our initial on-line products will include a bal day and next day financial product. (There is no day ahead settlement in this market). There are more than 10 industrial loads with greater than 150 MW concentrated at single meters offering good opportunities for real-time optimization. Our intent is to secure one of these within the next 2 months.<br>
<br>
I have included some price history to show the hourly volatility and a business plan to show the scope of the opportunity. In addition, we have very solid analytics that use power flow simulations to map out expected outcomes in the real-time market.<br>
<br>
The initial job opportunity will involve an analysis of the real-time market as it stands today with a view to trading around our information. This will also drive which specific assets we approach to manage. As we are loosely combining our Texas gas and Ercot power desks our information flow will be superior and I believe we will have all the tools needed for a successful real-time operation.<br>
<br>
Let me know if you have any further questions.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Doug</b></font><font color = gray>]</font>

Enron-omic Stimulus?<br>
<br>
Despite the continuing grip of a cold snap, and a rash of unit outages over<br>
the weekend, most Western power prices for Tuesday delivery ended slightly<br>
weaker in the first trading session of the new week.  "Flows are up and<br>
hydro's cheap," explained one marketer of the weather's inability to inject<br>
strength into Western markets.  "If the weather weren't as cold as it is,<br>
the market could even be worse for sellers."  As usual over the past few<br>
months, references to Enron were peppered across the mainstream media on<br>
Monday.  UBS Warburg, the Swiss bank that is in the process of purchasing<br>
the now-defunct EnronOnLine, plans to have the trading business in full<br>
operation by the end of February.  To staff the reborn operation, UBS<br>
Warburg has offered contracts to about 625 of EnronOnLine's 800 former<br>
employees.  The transaction is still pending the approval of various federal<br>
agencies.  In another chapter of the Enron saga, Vice Chairman J. Clifford<br>
Baxter's death was ruled a suicide by Harris County Medical Examiner Joye<br>
Carter on Saturday.  Baxter was considered an important potential witness in<br>
the Enron affair after whistle-blower Sherron Watkins cited his discussion<br>
with then-CEO Jeff Skilling about the company's dubious accounting<br>
practices.  A suicide note was found at the scene, but the details of the<br>
note have not yet been released.  Equally serious are allegations made by<br>
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, indicating that the White House had<br>
apparently changed the contents of a draft energy proposal circulated<br>
through Congress in March of last year to add a provision that specifically<br>
aided Enron Corp. in India.  According to Rep. Waxman, "the provision<br>
appears to have been added to the plan during the period in which the White<br>
House directly controlled the drafting."  The Bush Administration has<br>
understandably tried to distance itself from their biggest political<br>
contributor, denying that its energy plan was crafted to help Enron.  In<br>
related news, GAO head David M. Walker will likely sue Vice President Dick<br>
Cheney for refusing to turn over documents relating to the VP's meetings<br>
with Enron representatives last year.  It would mark the first time the<br>
investigative arm of Congress sued another branch of the government for refu<br>
sal to cooperate with an inquiry.  The Vice President insisted that the GAO<br>
was overstepping its bounds. "Their jurisdiction extends to agencies created<br>
by statute. That's not me," asserted Cheney, "I'm a constitutional officer.<br>
And the authority of the GAO does not extend in that case to my office."<br>
Save it for the judge, Dick.  In gas news, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas<br>
futures fell hard in Monday trading, with the February contract losing 12.9<br>
cents to settle at 1.908$/mmBtu, and the March contract close behind,<br>
plummeting 12 cents to close at 1.984$/mmBtu.<br>
<br>
Heavy load energy prices in the Northwest fell almost 2$/MWh on the low end<br>
for Tuesday delivery.  Healthy hydro flows and a cold front that did not<br>
quite live up to its prediction took the brunt of the blame.  Peak goods at<br>
Mid-Columbia changed hands from 18.8 to 22$/MWh on Monday.  Flows at Chief<br>
Joseph remained as strong as ever this year, coming in at 110 kcfs Tuesday,<br>
105 kcfs Wednesday and Thursday, 100 kcfs Friday, 85 kcfs Saturday, 65 kcfs<br>
Sunday, and 110 kcfs next Monday.  Temperatures were predicted to remain<br>
well below normal through Friday, with lows expected to flirt with freezing.<br>
The latest six-to-ten likewise called for temperatures to remain near to<br>
below normal from February 3 to 7.  There were no new unit outages to report<br>
on Monday.<br>
<br>
Despite cold weather and a modest rise in natural gas values at the Socal<br>
border, day-ahead electricity prices softened in the Golden State on Monday.<br>
Heavy load goods lost about 2$/MWh everywhere, while light load prices took<br>
a bigger hit, slipping almost 4$/MWH.  Peak power at SP15 traded between 23<br>
and 25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done closer to the high end, above<br>
24.25$/MWh. In California politicking, the CPUC voted to reject a compromise<br>
put forth by SDG&amp;E parent Sempra Energy.  The proposal would have used $219<br>
million of the $363 million earned selling power from five-year contracts at<br>
wholesale prices last summer to pay down the balancing account, and thus<br>
benefiting SDG&amp;E rate payers, while allocating the remaining $144 million to<br>
shareholders.  The CPUC said they think the courts will award a higher<br>
number to the balancing account. Californians may soon be allowed to choose<br>
their power provider again, if CPUC administrative law judge Robert Barnett<br>
has his way.  The initiative, a cornerstone of the 1996 deregulation </b></font><font color = gray>]</font>bill<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>,<br>
was revoked September 20, 2001.  However, consumers would have to hurry<br>
their selection, as the option would be back in play for a limited time,<br>
through July 1, 2002.  Barnett said competitive choice was essential to keep<br>
utility customers from unfairly footing the </b></font><font color = gray>]</font>bill<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b> for last year's energy<br>
crisis.  On the generation front, Morro Bay #4 (336 MW) and Pittsburg #7<br>
(682 MW) returned to service over the weekend.  Helms PGP #1 (407 MW) joined<br>
sister unit #2 (407 MW) in the out of service category on Monday.  Alamitos<br>
#3 (320 MW) exited the grid on January 26.  Hydro Big Creek (1,020 MW) was<br>
derated, operating at 720 MW.  Sutter Plants (546 MW) was generating at 270<br>
MW.  Tuesday forecasts called for temperatures to linger almost 10 degrees<br>
below normal, with highs in the upper-40s to mid-50s across the state.  The<br>
latest six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.<br>
<br>
The Southwest was a slight exception to the conditions prevalent across the<br>
WSCC on Monday.  While temperatures were lower than on Friday, peak power<br>
prices remained mostly flat.  Heavy load pieces at Palo Verde traded between<br>
22.75 and 25.75$/MWh, a loss of 75 cents on the low end and no change on the<br>
high.  Temperatures were expected to linger well below normal through<br>
Friday, and the latest six-to-ten predicted likewise from February 3 to 7.<br>
In unit news, coal-fired Navajo #3 (750 MW) returned to the grid Monday<br>
morning, while the ETR for Coronado #1 (395 MW) was revised to early morning<br>
Tuesday, January 29.  Fellow coal unit Huntington #2 (455 MW) also climbed<br>
back onto the grid over the weekend after repairing a tube leak.<br>

___________________________________________________________<br>
As unseasonably warm weather continued and traders harbored little hope of<br>
an upside in the gas market, peak power prices remained mostly steady on<br>
Monday across the Eastern Interconnect.  Traders reported light trading<br>
volume and lots of sunshine outside their windows.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural<br>
gas futures reached new contract lows on Monday, a familiar refrain heard<br>
during the past week.  February lost 12.9 cents in its second to last<br>
trading session, ending the day at 1.908$/mmBtu.  March plunged a similar 12<br>
cents to close at 1.984$/mmBtu.<br>
<br>
With a healthy generation landscape and temperatures more usual to late<br>
spring blanketing the region, day-ahead peak electricity prices settled<br>
lower in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.  Western PJM goods for Tuesday delivery<br>
changed hands between 20.95 and 22.1$/MWh, with most deals done in the 21.05<br>
to 21.5$/MWh range.  Balance of the week trades were heard around 21.7$/MWh,<br>
while balance of the month deals went through near 23.4$/MWh.  Despite an<br>
unusual brief spike to 73$/MWh just after 13:00 EST, LMPs were averaging<br>
21.26$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Traders reported lackluster trading and no<br>
new outages on Monday.  Tuesday forecasts called for high temperatures to<br>
linger in the balmy 63 to 68 degree range across PJM, before cooling about 5<br>
degrees on Wednesday.  The most current six-to-ten predicted normal<br>
temperatures from February 3 to 7.<br>
<br>
Despite record highs near 60 degrees and more of the same expected for<br>
Tuesday, heavy load energy costs were flat to slightly higher in the Midwest<br>
on Monday.  Into Cinergy deals for Tuesday delivery were heard between 17<br>
and 18.5$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions from 17.75 to 18$/MWh.  Most<br>
traders were surprised by the relative strength of the Cinergy hub.  "I<br>
suspect there are quite a few coal units turned off, and most maintenance<br>
schedules have been pushed forward, since the generation clearly isn't<br>
needed," commented one ECAR trader.  In unit news, Quad Cities #1 (821 MW)<br>
remained down for pump support maintenance.  Sources said they expected<br>
sister unit #2 (821 MW) to be taken off-line for the same repairs when #1<br>
returned to the grid, possibly as soon as this week.  The south shore of<br>
Lake Erie, a region where January snow is usually measured in feet, enjoyed<br>
high temperatures in the low-60s on Monday and anticipated the same on<br>
Tuesday.  Indeed, all of ECAR expected similar conditions for Tuesday, while<br>
cooling into the upper-40s was forecast for Wednesday.  The latest<br>
six-to-ten called for normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.<br>
<br>
As weak weather-related demand dominated SERC and Texas, peak power prices<br>
weakened on Monday.  Into Entergy deals were done between 15.5 and 18$/MWh,<br>
with the low end reached late in the day.  "I don't see any possibility of a<br>
rally for February.  Gas was hammered again today; the market is very soft<br>
right now," commented one SERC realist.  Tuesday was expected to see high<br>
temperatures solidly in the 70s across SERC and Texas, with slight cooling<br>
predicted as the week progresses.  The most current six-to-ten called for<br>
normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.<br>

<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>With </b></font><font color = gray>]</font>Ken<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b> Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.<br>
<br>
First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.<br>
<br>
The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.<br>
<br>
Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.<br>
<br>
As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.<br>
<br>
In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.<br>
<br>
We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.<br>
<br>
Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.<br>

Being that he realized he was wrong and appologized I wouldnt want to jeopardize any future realationship with LADWP over one instance with him as he has been okay in the past.  However you will need to still pull the tapes for Geirs conversation which occured somewhere between 16:00 and 17:30.  Thanks.</b></font><font color = gray>]</font>

I had quite a bad conversation with Kirk at LADWP yesterday.  Geir supposed=<br>

irk at LA and told him that Geir said he didnt purchase power from him and =<br>
that we would just pull the tapes in the morning to solve the dispute.  Kir=<br>

Just wanted you to know that EPE lost one of the Turbines hour ending 18 @ about 17:30 or so...I tried to buy power from everyone but to almost no avail (exept 50mw @ 53.00 integrated to a 13mw 3/4 past the hour)...Furthermore, I cut IID to a 100mw from a 120mw which integrated to a 115mw (being as I kept the first 100 whole),<br>
<br>
For HE 19 I was forced to cut one of a 25mw purchase from PNM @ $32.00 to a 13mw because our imports were over capacity.  I also bought back 50mw from IID for HE 20 @ $40.00.<br>

Great suggestion.  Yes, a meeting is needed, especially for same day<br>
timelines.<br>
<br>
May I suggest the conference center meeting rooms at the Portland Airport?<br>
A fly-in, fly-out meeting 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.<br>
<br>
If you have a better location or better idea, speak-up.  Otherwise, I'll<br>
check on availability of a room.  Looks like we are down to the last two<br>
weeks of this month - 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, or 27.<br>

I'll try to send out a list of topics for an agenda tomorrow.<br>

Jerry<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b> Dempsey has sent the attached regarding the preschedule flag in E-Tag.<br>
<br>
What he is proposing is:<br>
*	a revision to the timeline tables in A3A to enable software to make<br>
the determination of whether or not a tag is for preschedule or real-time<br>
(currently it is a flag set by the PSE creating the tag).<br>
*	Referencing time in terms of the Load Control Area's prevailing time<br>
(this fits the Authority Service is associated with the load control area<br>
and it's the Authority Service that keeps the time).<br>
<br>
It may be possible to get this revision worked in to the 1.7 release.<br>
<br>
Process<br>
Please review his proposal and comment.<br>
Specifically, do you support the concept of removing the flag and using the<br>
timing table logic?<br>
Do you support adjusting times to reference the Load Control Area prevailing<br>
time?<br>
<br>
If we reach a consensus on this issue by the end of the week, we can forward<br>
on a recommendation to Mark for distribution to the whole ISAS.  If there is<br>
support from all of ISAS, then it can be taken to NERC IS/TISWG for<br>
approval.<br>
<br>
Please let me know by the end of business June 15, 2001.<br>

&gt; Yes, that's right, you did raise your hand for this.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We are to submit to ISAS any recommendation(s) by August ??, 2001 (what<br>
&gt; was the date, I didn't write it down).<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Is there benefit to have a face-to-face meeting?  Either way, we'll use<br>
&gt; e-mail for discussion and maybe a conference call or two.<br>

&gt; Questions to keep in mind:<br>
&gt; *	Are our current timelines as good as it gets?<br>
&gt; *	Do we want to adopt the Eastern Interconnection's timelines?<br>
&gt; *	What are the deficiencies of our timelines?<br>
&gt; *	Will these deficiencies be present under 1.7?<br>
&gt; *	Which timing requirements could be changed with an reasonable amount<br>

Don't worry, I have nothing against players.  Just<br>

<br>
I hope you had a good time at the show last weekend.<br>
Maktub were pretty cool.  I know they play around<br>
Seattle frequently so I'll check them out again<br>
sometime.  Maybe you'll luck out and they'll come to<br>
Portland soon.  I'm sure you have a decent music scene<br>
in Portland so you always have other options.  I've<br>
found that you can find some really cool little bands<br>
or musicians in the most random little bars and<br>
restaurants.<br>
<br>
I hope all is well in Portland at the moment.  Seattle<br>
has been pretty sunny and warm so I can't complain.<br>
I'm totally looking forward to summer.  There will be<br>
something to do every weekend.  Thank god.  Time to<br>
start taking all my "sick" days!<br>
<br>
Have a good day.  Don't work too hard.   If you do,<br>
make sure you play harder to make up for it.<br>
<br>
Talk to you later.<br>

3.  I still was unable to resolve the 25 mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew, and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule.
