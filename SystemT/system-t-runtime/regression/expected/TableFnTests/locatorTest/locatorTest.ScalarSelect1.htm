<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>Hey there Bill!<br>
<br>
I thought I'd drop a quick line just to do a quick introduction of myself.<br>
Your buddy, Brendan, has offered your tour guide ability to me when I visit<br>
Portland in July.  I do have a college friend out there (who I hope to<br>
locate) so you might not have to be stuck with me. :)<br>
<br>
Anyhow I'm Nikki.  I'd go more into depth but everytime I write it out it<br>
sounds more like a personal add then an introduction!<br>
<br>
Brendan tells me you are about to close on a condo.  Congratulations!  I<br>
can't wait to have a place of my own!  Apartment life is horrible.  My<br>
neighbor and I knock on the bathroom wall at each other in the mornings just<br>
to say "hi".  I'm really serious.  I actually have really great neighbors in<br>
my building and I have to admit, apartment life is a good way to get to know<br>
people.<br>
<br>
I don't know what Brendan has told you about me but here's the story.  I was<br>
born and raised in New Mexico and hate it here!  I need trees and green!<br>
Someone once compared landing in New Mexico to landing in a litter box.<br>
Where there's not dirt there's piles of crap.  Now everytime a plane flies<br>
me back home I look around and agree.<br>
<br>
So, to say the least I'm a little stir crazy for a new environment.  The<br>
first part of August I will be moving to Newport Beach, California.  Or one<br>
of four other beach communities in that area.  I want to experience that<br>
whole lifestyle for at least a year.  Then I'm moving to Oregon.  I've never<br>
visited or anything I'm just drawn there.  To be perfectly honest it's<br>
because of the two movies "Goonies" and "Kindergarten Cop".  I loved those<br>
movies as a kid and have wanted to move to Astoria ever since.  Now's my<br>
chance.  I just finished college and have a period of resting time before I<br>
go after my master's in Public Health Administration or my MBA.  We'll see<br>
which fits me best later.  I don't feel that at 24 I can really decide the<br>
"best" avenue for the next 50 years of my career so I'm waiting for the life<br>
experience to kick in and lead the way later.<br>
<br>
As of yet I have no set plans as to dates, iteneraries, etc and so forth.<br>
I'm a very spontaneous type of person I don't really "do" planning and<br>
scheduling.  I just kind of show up and try to make my own fun.  It's better<br>
that way.  Life can be too organized!<br>
<br>
Well now that I've given you a "short" introduction...haha.  I'd love to<br>
hear back from you about any conflicting dates that you might have in July.<br>
Don't worry if they change I won't hold ya to them.  The only time that I am<br>
forecasting for myself is the 12th through the 16th (of July) IF I don't go<br>
to Calgary, Canada.  Currently I'm planning as many trips as I possibly can.<br>
My youth is fading fast and I need to enjoy as much of it as I possible<br>
while I don't have a husband and kids to take care of. :)<br>
<br>
Hope to hear from you soon!<br>
Nikki<br>
<br>

Thank you so much for writing back to me. I have been missing you like crazy without any way of getting in touch with you.  How are things going?  We have so much catching up to do.  I realize more than ever what a special friend you are and how much I have missed our conversations.  I hope all is going wonderful with you.  Things here are great.  I am almost done with my second year of school (only 2 more weeks)  I just took a comprehensive exam over the last 2 years and I think I passed.  I am constantly amazed that I am almost done with school and will soon be practicing medicine on poor innocent people.  I'll actually be in Seattle all of August and September, so hopefully we can arrange some kind of meeting so I can give you a big hug.<br>
How is work?  Are you still doing the same job?  I know last time we talked you had all kinds of crazy ideas floating around about moving to Europe or Japan or something crazy like that.  In fact, that is what I thought had happened and I was so scared that i would not be able to find you.  Do you still have your wonderful motorcycle?  I know you were moving to a new home the last time we talked, but I know nothing about it.  are you living by yourself, in a condo, a home, an apartment?  Anything else wild and crazy that I have missed hearing about?  I'm sure there is....<br>
Well, I just had to check something quickly off the internet before class today, and unfortunately I must go.  But it was wonderful to see your name and hear that you are alive and well.  I will definately be calling you this week to catch up.<br>
I have missed you my friend, take care,<br>

Thank you for returning the paperwork to me. They are installing hardwoods<br>
on 4th floor right now. (I was down there this am). The Lobby is<br>
complete...just some touch up needed. Elevator is up &amp; running.<br>
<br>
At this time, we need you to identify a Lender and get yourself pre-approved<br>
and have the Lender pre-approve the project. Because it is a conversion,<br>
some Lenders have trouble doing the loan. Jerry Wilson of Pacific Northwest<br>
Mortgage, Inc. has pre-approved this project and is doing a number of other<br>
loans at the Roosevelt.<br>
In case you'd like his number it is: 503-224-4564 or pager 503-224-4308<br>
(Tell him you are calling re: Roosevelt).<br>
<br>
Let me know which Lender you are working with and I will give them the<br>

<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>Group,<br>
<br>
Going forward we will be transacting with Enron Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis.  We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for non-firm energy trades.  Enron Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possibilities for export and import.  We should be familiar with the Alberta Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD.  The lead or NW trader will provide Enron Canada with their estimate or feel of the market each morning and throughout the day.<br>
<br>
Enron Canada will be trying to obtain non-firm transmission nearly every hour.  WE need to tell them if this is an unwise practice from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, as they will lose around $7 per mw (CDD) on unused transmission with zero chance for return.<br>
<br>
Further, Enron Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.  They will give us the first look, but if we cannot use their energy, they will contact WWP, IPC, TransAlta or other counterparty in an attempt to recoup some of their loss.  I do not see a need for this and I think it leaves us open to tainted customer relationships, financial loss, and embarrassment.  If we are in contact with Enron Canada before the fact (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.  Be very clear in your dealings with NW counterparties that you are buying or selling a non-firm product.  Determine a book-out price to solve problems with physical flow if necessary.  We are basically buying a put or a call and should pay our counterparty appropriately.<br>
<br>
Finally, I would like to see improved communication with Enron Canada.  It appears we have limited our contacts within our own company and hindered the flow of information to both parties' detriment.  I feel we can do better.  I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Enron Canada and Enron North America.  This is counterproductive for both parties for obvious reasons.  Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with Enron Canada.  This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that can only be beneficial.  If you have questions or ideas regarding our relationship with Enron Canada, please let me know.<br>

Enron Global LNG<br>
Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world's growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels.   Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for Enron's wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market.<br>

Enron Corp. Says First-Quarter Profit Rose 20 Percent<br>
Houston, April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent as sales almost quadrupled. Profit from operations rose to $406 million, or 47 cents, from $338 million, or 40 cents, in the year-earlier period.  Enron raised its 2001 profit forecast to $1.75 to $1.80 a share, from its January projection of $1.70 to $1.75.<br>
<br>
First-quarter revenue surged to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion as Enron boosted the volume of power sold in North America by 90 percent. Enron had a first-quarter gain of $19 million, or 2 cents a share, for an accounting change, making net income $425 million, or 49 cents a share. There were no charges or gains in the year-earlier period.<br>

<font color = gray>[</font><font color = #8833bb><b>To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge.<br>
<br>
The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.<br>
<br>
The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.<br>
<br>
Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.<br>
<br>
On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.<br>
<br>
By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization.<br>
<br>
Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:<br>

Course Description<br>
This course builds on our Applied Energy Derivatives program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective.  Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring / marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.  Applied Energy Derivatives, or its equivalent is a prerequisite for this program; no other advanced preparation is required.  CPE Credits: Accounting &amp; Auditing 2; Consulting Services 1; Management 1; Specialized Knowledge &amp; Applications 12.<br>
<br>
At the conclusion of this course, participants will be able to:<br>
Decipher the role of the price curve, volatility, and time in determining the intrinsic value and time value of an option premium<br>
Understand how a dealer 'trades volatility' and dynamically hedges an option<br>
Recognize the limitations of traditional option pricing models when applied to energy<br>
Annualize a periodic (e.g. monthly) volatility and vice versa<br>
Create synthetic puts and calls using put-call parity to exploit mispriced options<br>
Incorporate volatility term structures, "smiles and skews", in analyzing deals<br>
Establish a delta-neutral hedge of an option and calculate the cost of changing prices on that hedge position<br>
Comprehend the relationship between gamma and actual price volatility and its consequent implications for a dealer's earnings<br>
Anticipate the irregular changes in gamma by stress testing option portfolios, thereby allowing more informed position management<br>
Interpret an aggregated risk management report for an option portfolio and the positive or negative values for delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho<br>
Structure an option on a swap to create innovative hedges for customers<br>
Create extendable and cancelable fixed price deals<br>
Embed a swaption sale to create sub-index physical supply to a user<br>
Compare the merits and earnings opportunities among various alternatives available to a customer seeking to reverse an existing swap position<br>
Determine the cash value of a swap terminated before its end date<br>
Apply swaps with off-market fixed prices to monetize value in existing contracts or to provide for the cash/borrowing needs of a customer<br>
Combine off-market swaps in complex structures: e.g. "blend-and-extend"</b></font><font color = gray>]</font>

============<br>
<br>
Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including holiday parties, post-quarterly meeting outings, and going away parties. While I hope that people thoroughly enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act professionally and responsibly during and after these events. I have been working with Chris Calger and Amy FitzPatrick to put together some guidelines for company-sponsored social events:<br>
<br>
The company will provide soft drinks, beer and wine. You may choose to order other beverages at your expense.<br>
Functions will run for a specified period of time. If there is an open bar, we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any additional drinks.<br>
If you require assistance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked. The last thing in the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the safety of others in jeopardy.<br>
<br>
============<br>
