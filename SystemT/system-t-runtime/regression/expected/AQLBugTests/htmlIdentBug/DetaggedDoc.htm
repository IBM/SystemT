Just today we announced the availability of some of our middleware, free for developers, on Amazon.  You can get to these either from the Amazon catalog, or from our developerWorks site.  I am a firm believer that cloud will be a mixture of the economics of hardware, middleware and service offerings.  This announcement (alongwith others such as this ) are the first few steps in IBM's full participation in the cloud phenomenom.  As you know, I have been formulating over the last few months a few points of views re. cloud, and I will continue to articulate them from a vendor neutral perspective, but this was significant enough (for the importance of Amazon, and for us working through some internal business process/model issues) that I wanted to give a "shout out" to my database team and our developer relations team under Dave Mitchell for making this happen.<br>

        Cloud Substitutability: Is it Really Important?<br>

Recently I attended a cloud interoperability forum organized by Stephen O'Grady and Dave Berlind (thanks to both of them for corralling such disparate voices).  There I got into a mini-argument with Tim Bray , who was asserting that the most important thing from an interoperability perspective is substitutability, i.e. there should be no vendor (cloud provider) lockin.  That CIO's say, if there is lockin, they are not moving stuff to the cloud.  My argument against it is simple: there are many dimensions to why an organization may choose to move some of its workloads to the cloud.  Substitutability or no vendor locking (see my blog ) is just one of them, and I would assert not even the most important one for now.  Cloud economics, security, loss of control, network effects, bandwidth, ecosystem, integration needs etc etc all important.  Every CIO is being asked to do more with less, and consequently, substitutability or lack thereof is just one of the dimensions to the complex puzzle of moving stuff to the cloud.<br>

        Cloud: Good for large number of small problems or small number of large problems?<br>

First, to all my fans out there (hello, anyone really there, or you all have given up?):  Ok, Ok, I get it -- I cannot call myself a blogger and be absent for two months.  Sorry!  But Mr. Regularity is back on the scene (I know, this regularity term has been hijacked by some over the counter medicine folks, but so be it). So what's been keeping me busy?  Clouds and Mashups, my twin passions.  I will try to alternate the two in my postings this year.  Let me first begin with cloud.  I want to run a hypothesis by you all.  I see two sets of workloads in the cloud.  A large number of small problems (example, salesforce.com , where all queries/transactions come with a tenant-id attached) or a small number of large problems (example, google with its bigtable usage).  Sometimes we tend to get over excited about the latter -- infinite scalability, 1000's of nodes, a computer science student's dream.  But as salesforce.com has shown, one can make a handy billion dollars by efficiently solving a large number of small problems too.  The nice thing about managing a large number of small problems is that one does not, up and down in the stack, need to manage everything as one large server, one large storage or one large database.  Right "scaleout" models can be built at different layers of the stack, giving one a lot of flexibility.  That is why salesforce.com can run on Oracle, whereas google is custom top to bottom. If we think this way, then we immediately understand infrastructural needs, which is (the size of the problem)*(number of {concurrent} problems).  It is clear that for google, this translates to multiple hundreds of thousands.  One reason why the size of the problem for google is large is because of the #of bits (~PB) and another is because the amount of computation needed for analytics is elastic and the larger, the better, and therefore can be easily ~1000/problem.  For salesforce, my suspicion is that the total infrastructural need is considerably less.  Now you might say, salesforce is about transactional apps, and transactional apps are not very "infrastructure" intensive.  Whatever the merits of that argument, I find this way of looking at cloud workloads to be quite worthwhile.<br>

I have always made a point that enterprise mashups will succeed because of two primary reasons<br>
They create a partnership between LOB's and IT, enabling IT to do what it does best -- unlock information, and the business users to do what they do best -- build what is exactly needed by them.  In addition, it can help justify the ROI of projects so as to enable IT to focus on building those apps that have a proven ROI.<br>
And guaranteeing security, access control and the rights -- balancing them with flexibility ( creativity and control ) will make them "permissible" within the enterprise.<br>

So I got a chance to host a session in MR's Cloud Summit at the Computer History Museum yesterday on Cloud Standards.  I began by asserting that a lot of innovation/standardization activity goes through the following three phases:<br>
 Fundamentally, for first 5 years, rapid innovation does not need standards and standards might inhibit the adoption.  In the next phase, there is a distinct fear of lockin, which sometimes leads to standards, sometimes interoperability leads to standards, but eventually, the industry consolidates in this phase and standards typically emerge (such as SQL).  In the next phase, there is another period of growth, but vendors find new ways to create lockins (e.g., stored procedure languages in the database world). So the question is, what about cloud.  My hypothesis in the pitch was the following<br>
 That different layers of the cloud infrastructure are in different phases.  The bottom is more amenable to standards (such as OVF ), than one version of the middle tier is -- the version that is pushing for a new "stack" (such as force.com, Google app engine, Amazon S3 etc.).  However, another version of the middle-tier, which is taking traditional 3-tier apps and moving them to the cloud is already well past the standards phase, because these applications have made their decisions on Oracles, DB2's, WebSpheres and BEA's.  It was  lively discussion and I will need to refine my hypothesis and theory, but I would welcome comments. And more on what I saw and heard at the summit later.<br>

With all the news about google's chrome , and the release of the nerdy (in a good way :) comic , what really struck me was pages 9 through 11.  Got me and Carl Kessler talking.  SaaS = testing advantage?  In what environments?  <br>
<br>
Public data, ok yes billions of web pages in every shape and form ==&gt; thorough testing<br>
But private data? Private "user" behavior?<br>
<br>
Is there some written/unwritten rules on what is permissible?  We had always looked at privacy and data mining.  What about privacy and "software" testing? BTW, I am blogging this from 37K ft above the ground, on AA's gogo wifi   Pretty cool, high time.<br>

Take SaaS and cloud for example.  The die-hards say, this is the world that will take over and kill all existing IT deployments (over time, of course, they are not silly enough to say it will happen at the speed of thought :).  The contrarians will say, "been there, done that, remember 2000 and all the business model up-endings?"  As always, the breathless excitement of new stuff dominates the ink. So I give you, without commentary, two "contrarian" views on SaaS and Cloud.  Make sure you read the comments which are almost uniformly "contrary to the contrarian approaches." First, on SaaS, the CEO of Lawson, in an interview.    Central thesis: "SaaS model does not compute from a profit perspective." Second, the bits blog by David Gallagher in NYTimes here.   Central thesis: (1) Millions of email addresses makes bad things more likely compared to ones corporate mail "address completion." (2) Live documents in google docs model have more potential for mischief. <br>

Even though the esteemed group chose not to invite me :), it is hard for me to disagree with the conclusions in this report .  It captures exactly the right thoughts, and should be a must read for everyone involved in the area of databases and database research in particular. But today I want to address a different topic -- the democratization of information.  Ever since I attended the Linked Data Planet conference, I got a religion.  Not one of strict linking -- that is fine, and see my other posts on my views there.  But really of "open data".  Many many forms of data are now available on the web.  US Census information .  Indian Census information .  Wikipedia's Infobox .  Country Facts .  They are available in linkeddata form, such as linked open data , but they are also available in xls, in csv, in &lt;tr&gt; forms in html; they are everywhere.  There are brokers of these information -- strikeiron , melissadata .  They are free to use, or absolutely not free to use.  To me, this is the real transformation.  Not just the future of database research, but the future of data.<br>

&lt;div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I was on a panel in Washington DC last week in a workshop on &lt;a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xinfoshare/committees/editorial_0699.shtm"&gt;Privacy and Data Mining&lt;/a&gt; for Department of Homeland Security.  The topic, of course, can be quite incendiary.  But the focus of the panel was on privacy preserving data mining technology, so we kept the discussion at a technical level and avoided politics or policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;The points I made on the panel (other panelists were &lt;a href="http://portal.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100204478"&gt;Chris Clifton&lt;/a&gt; from Purdue, and &lt;a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~rebecca.wright/"&gt;Rebecca Wright&lt;/a&gt; from DIMACS and Rutgers) were the following&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;li&gt;Commercial businesses are very much interested in this too, and this interest is driving technology innovation that can be leveraged in DHS situations.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;While data mining and privacy preserving aspects of it have the fiery appeal, the fact is that privacy preservation is critical across all aspects of a data lifecycle -- data at rest, data in motion, data graveyard, test, production, integration etc. -- many copies of data existing before and after the data mining. Consequently, having bullet-proof privacy preservation in the data mining "part" of this chain is not sufficient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;That IBM and other vendors have built up a repertoire of capabilities, primarily from a commercial perspective.  I highlighted the research of &lt;a href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/disciplines/iis/"&gt;Hippocratic Databases&lt;/a&gt; and the privacy preserving technologies in our &lt;a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/ips/products/masterdata/eas/"&gt;Entity Analytics Solutions&lt;/a&gt; as two sets of examples of these.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;/ol&gt;<br>
It is always risky wading into such controversial topics, but I enjoyed the panel very much, learnt from the other panelists, and equally importantly, learnt from other panels.  I think such dialogs are critical. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;I want to especially thank &lt;a href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/tgrandison/"&gt;Tyrone Grandison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 23px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 22px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 21px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 20px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 19px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 17px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px; "&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/sasha/"&gt;Alexandre Evfimievski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://jeffjonas.typepad.com/"&gt;Jeff Jonas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span style="font-size: 10px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 11px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px; "&gt;Katie Ignaszewski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 23px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 22px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 21px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 20px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 19px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 18px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 17px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 14px; "&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 13px; "&gt;and our Chief Privacy Officer, &lt;a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/biography/10073.wss"&gt;Harriet Pearson&lt;/a&gt;, for helping me with the talk and the panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>

&lt;li&gt;InfoSphere MashupHub, which allows you to catalog information, and mix and match feeds -- whether they are departmental, enterprise or external.&amp;nbsp; Fundamentally, the mix and match happens by dragging and dropping feeds and wiring them together for "data operations" (select, joins, merge, transform etc.).&amp;nbsp; On Greenhouse, InfoSphere MashupHub can be reached &lt;a href="https://greenhouse.lotus.com/mashuphub"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>
&lt;li&gt;Lotus Mashups, which allows you to create pages (interactive views) by dragging and dropping widgets on to a palette and wiring them together.&amp;nbsp; The widgets display information (typically from InforSphere MashupHub) and/or perform different behavior based on actions in another widget.&amp;nbsp; Pages or widgets created for or in Lotus Mashups get cataloged back in InfoSphere MashupHub.&amp;nbsp; On Greehouse, Lotus Mashups can be reached &lt;a href="https://greenhouse.lotus.com/mum/enabler"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;<br>
<br>
&lt;/ol&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;I will be periodicaly posting mashups on Greenhouse so that I can help explain the different use cases, but you will find many already there.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us know your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br>
