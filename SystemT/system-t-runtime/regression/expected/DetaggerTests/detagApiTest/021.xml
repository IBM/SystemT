Bogview Manor

We made reservation for the Bogview Manor over the phone 
with WhereToSleep.com.  It was after 6pm when we called.  When we
got to the room we found out it did not have a window that opened. 
After calling several times to WhereToSleep.com, they
don't think they could give us our money back because the hotel keeps
it after the cancellation policy time of 6:00 pm.  The thing is that  
the room did not have the features as promised to WhereToSleep.com
and the hotel did not have a room that did.  We didn't stay there.
