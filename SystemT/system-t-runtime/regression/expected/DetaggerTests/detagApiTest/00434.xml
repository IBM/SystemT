NeverAgain Motel
overcharge
travel-hotel

We booked a hotel with wheretosleep.com for three nights for our anniversary.
When we checked out, the NeverAgain Motel made us pay more!  
They said it was for taxes and fees, but we are sure that the 
charge we made to wheretosleep.com was supposed to cover the room in full.
The customer service rep at WhereToSleep com 
(after many telephone calls) finally told me that that the hotel was wrong
to charge us because we should get the 
wheretosleep.com corporate rate.  When we called the hotel they pretty much
laughed at that.  Of course we paid 
the NeverAgain Motel the extra charge but this really is an overcharge.
A deal's a deal!
