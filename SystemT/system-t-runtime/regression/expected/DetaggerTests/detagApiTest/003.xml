We booked the Marmalade hotel for a fixed rate for 3 nights at a 
total of $249.78.
When we checked out, the cost of the room 
with taxes was $382.48,which is $132.70 more than the rate 
wheretosleep.com 
told us we were getting. So, upon our return, I attempted to get the 
credit for the 
$132.70 since they have a guarantee on this, so I thought. I was told 
by the customer care representative that the hotel should have never 
given us that bill because they agreed to a wheretosleep.com 
corporate rate. So, 
I got stuck with $132.70 that I should not owe.
