NeverAgain Motel
overcharge
travel-hotel

We booked a hotel for four nights with wheretosleep.com.
When we checked out, the NeverAgain Motel gave us a receipt. 
That receipt showed that the total room cost with the extra taxes
for $222.22 which was more than the $192.48 than the rate 
that we paid wheretosleep.com, which was supposed to cover the room in full.
It took my many tries to reach the WhereToSleep.com customer service and they
said the hotel should not have charged us extra because they have a 
special corporate rate and that covered 
all other fees and taxes on the hotel bill. We had 
no choice but to pay the NeverAgain Motel the extra charge but we dispute this
as an overcharge.  You should tell other customers not to use WhereToSleep.com!
