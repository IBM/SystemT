charged for a cancelled transaction

We booked a hotel with wheretosleep.com. When arrived at the hotel, we were 
told that our reservation got cancelled, so we paid the hotel and figured
we could get the money back from the online site.
I called wheretosleep.com four times and they said they would 
get the hotel to cancel the charge to our credit card and 
send an email confirming same. But I'm still waiting for that email. 
I have sent them 2 emails and called them again. Still nothing.
