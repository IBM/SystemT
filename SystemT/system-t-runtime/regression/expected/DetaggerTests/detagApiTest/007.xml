We made an online reservation in the early evening for the Desperado Inn 
while we were travelling.
When we got there, no reservation and no vacancy!
We made several telephone calls to WhereToSleep.com and finally got someone
who was unable to help us. 
The hotel didn't havee a room!  On top of that, WhereToSleep.com says
we agreed to their "cancellation policy".  The hotel didn't have a room!!
