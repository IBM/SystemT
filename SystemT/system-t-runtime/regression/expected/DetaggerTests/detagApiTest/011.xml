Sherlock hotel

charged twice

We have a big problem with getting my refunds...it was double charged by the 
Sherlock hotel and wheretosleep.com...30 days back when I called customer support 
they told I will 
get my money back in 3 days...I called them again after 30 days after I got my 
credit card statement...the same story repeated (I need to narrate whole 
circumstances again, they verified with hotel, they dont keep any record of which 
agent spoke to me and any confirmation information), customer service told I will 
get it in 3 days..I will get the refund confirmation email in 15 mins to 24 Hrs...
even after 7 days I didnt get any email...this is happened twice with customer call.
