Mini Biography<br>
Javier Bardem is the youngest member of a family of actors that has been making films since the early days of Spanish cinema.He got his start in the family business at age six when he appeared in his first feature, "El Pícaro" (The Scoundrel). During his teenage years he acted in several TV series, played rugby for theSpanish National Team, and toured the country with an independent theatrical group. Javier's early film role as a sexy stud in the black comedy_Jamón, jamón (1992)_ (Ham Ham) propelled him to instant popularity and threatened to typecast him as nothing morethan a brawny sex symbol. Determined to avert a beefcake image, he refused similar subsequent roles and has gone on to win acclaim for his ability to appear almost unrecognizable from film to film. With over 25 movies and numerous award s under his belt, it is Javier's stirring, passionate performance as the persecuted Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas in Before Night Falls (2000) that will longbe remembered as his breakthrough role. He received five Best Actor award s and a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal of a strong-willed man who survived censorship, im prison ment, and homosexual intolerance for the privilege to write freely, only to commit suicide at age 47 in New York, ending a battle with AIDS.<br>

Trivia<br>
Brother of Carlos Bardem and Mónica Bardem . Son of Pilar Bardem Nephew of director Juan Antonio Bardem Grandson of Rafael Bardem Is the first Spanish actor ever to be nominated for an Academy Award. Says in interviews that he doesn't know how to drive. Played rugby as a teen and was on the Spanish National team. Ten years ago a stranger in a disco asked him his name. When Javier replied, the man punched him in the face for no apparent reason, breaking his nose. Javier's original interest was in painting, and he studied at Madrid's Escuela de Artes y Officios. Eventually deciding he'd never be a talented painter, he drifted into a number of odd jobs, working as a bouncer, a writer, a construction worker and even a stripper. To portray Reinaldo Arenas, Javier not only learned Cuban-Spanish,but Cuban- accented English, and lost 30 pounds to better resemble the smaller-framed Arenas. Javier, his mother, Pilar Bardem and his siblings, Mónica Bardem and Carlos Bardem often appear in each other's films. Lives in Madrid with his long-time girlfriend, Cristina. [2003] Has four Goya Awards (the Spanish equivalent of the Oscar). To become Ramón Sampedro, a 55-year-old Spanish man who made headlines with a crusade to end his own life, Javier, aged 35, was on the set of "The Sea Inside" at the crack of dawn for a five-hour makeup session that produced the necessary aging. Member of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 2005 Spanish citizen. Shares birthday with Frédéric Chopin and David Niven. Actors Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna list him as their favorite actor. Very good friends with Penelope Cruz. Beat out Johnny Depp for the role of Florentino Ariza in Love in the Time of Cholera. Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history (#73). [2007]. First Spanish performer to win an Oscar. Took his mother to the Oscars in 2008.<br>

Personal Quotes<br>
One of my dreams came true when Julian [Schnabel] showed the movie [ Before Night Falls (2000)] to Al Pacino and he called me at 3 a.m. Spanish time and told me he liked my performance. I told him, 'I don't believe in God, I believe in Al Pacino .' "I'm in love with my English teacher. We have many of our lessons in bed." - his girlfriend, Cristina, is a translator in Spain, and is coaching her boyfriend. I live in Spain. Oscars are something that are on TV Sunday night, basically, very late at night. You don't watch, you just read the news after to see who won or who lost... The award is important in order to bring people to the movie theater. That's the only principal meaning of any award . We are so scared about talking about death that we are letting people die in silence. It is good to talk publicly. It would be amazing to think your film or your performance had the power to make changes, but it's enough that it makes people talk and think. Maybe they shouldn't do anything anyway. The Church has strong feelings and we respect that. It's exhausting, almost a full-time job. Last time, I found it was too much about bringing attention to yourself. - On his Oscar nomination for Before Night Falls. I'm proud of the fact that I got so many people to sit down and watch a story like Before Night Falls even at the expense, I felt, of some of my personal life. I think the movie speaks of a lack of meaning in violence. I embody violence, I am violence itself in the movie, and there is a man ... who is trying to understand the meaning of it and at the end there is no meaning. - On No Country for Old Men. I'm getting more comfortable now, but it will never get to the point as if you are doing it in your own language. When I say 'I love you' or 'I hate you' in Spanish, many things come to my mind, aspects of my own life. When I say it in English, I don't have the memories. All the work I usually do: imagining the past, the circumstances of the character in this case I didn't do it. We all saw him as a force of nature the embodiment of violence. - On his character Chigurh in No Country for Old men ''I wish I could work with him again. He's so secret. He doesn't even tell me and I go, "Give me a break man. Give me a role." He works secretly. I guess he will be shooting soon. I hope so, because he's amazing.'' On working with Amenabar again. All of the good movies are based on how that story was told. And you cannot do it with a bad script, that's for sure, no matter who. What does my performance have to do with Russell Crowe 's? Nothing. If I play Gladiator (2000) and we all play Gladiator with Ridley Scott in the same amount of time, maybe we have a chance to see who did it best. We actors always say how difficult and physically demanding a role was. But give me a break, it's only a movie. The only thing I can do is act, but it's not something I even feel comfortable doing. It costs me a lot, because I'm a shy person, even if I don't look it. Sometimes I say to myself, what are you doing in this absurd job? Why don't you go to Africa and help people? But I cannot help people, because I am a hypochondriac. When the Coens called, I said, 'Listen, I'm the wrong actor. I don't drive, I speak bad English, and I hate violence.' They laughed and said, 'Maybe that's why we called you.' - on No Country for Old Men (2007)<br>

Mini Biography<br>
The iconoclastic gifts of the visually striking and enigmatic actress Tilda Swinton, who was born on November 5th, 1960, in London, have been appreciated by a more international audience of late. Born into a patrician Scottish military family, she was educated in an English boarding school along with Princess Diana . Tilda subsequently studied at Social and Politcal Science Cambridge University, but changed courses and graduated in 1983 with a degree in English Literature. She performed a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. A decided rebel when it came to the arts, she left abruptly after a year as her approach shifted dramatically. With a taste for the unique and bizarre, she found some genuinely interesting gender-bending roles come her way, such as the composer Mozart in Pushkin's "Mozart and Salieri", and as a working class woman impersonating her dead husband during World War II, in Karges' Man to Man (1992). Tilda would commit the latter role to film in 1991. In 1985 the pale-skinned, carrot-topped actress began a professional association with director/mentor Derek Jarman . This quirky alliance would produce such stark turns in Caravaggio (1986), Aria (1987), The Last of England (1988), The Garden (1990) Edward II (1991), and Wittgenstein (1993), while feeding this voracity for playing the unique and unusual. Tilda provided a voice in his final film, an inventive documentary entitled Blue (1993/I), which used only a blue screen and interweaving vocal soundtrack to drive home its themes of dying and death. Jarman succumbed to complications from AIDS shortly after its completion. His untimely demise left a devastating void in Tilda's life for quite some time. Ironically, her most notable film role may come from a non-Jarman film. For the title role in the Sally Potter -directed stunner Orlando (1992), her nobleman character actually lives for 400 years while changing sex from man to woman. Over the years she has preferred to sacrifice celebrity for art, opening herself to experimental projects with new and untried directors and mediums. Consistently off-centered roles in Female Perversions (1996), Conceiving Ada (1997), Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon (1998), and Possible Worlds (2000) have only added to her mystique. Hollywood too has picked up on this notoriety, but not nearly as well. With the exception of the thriller The Deep End (2001), which earned her a number of critic's award s, such mainstream U.S. pictures as The Beach (2000/I) with Leonardo DiCaprio , Vanilla Sky (2001) starring Tom Cruise and the Keanu Reeves horror epic Constantine (2005) have tended to undermine her seemingly boundless abilities.<br>

Personal Quotes<br>
The other day, I was going through the airport security and I was searched by a male security guard. I'm very often referred to as "Sir" in elevators and such. I think it has to do with being this tall and not wearing much lipstick. I think people just can't imagine I'd be a woman if I look like this. I'm basically interested in identity, and I still find fascinating the question, "How do we identify ourselves, and how do we settle into other people's expectations for our identity?" There is something insane about a lack of doubt. Doubt, to me anyway, is what makes you human, and without doubt even the righteous lose their grip not only on reality but also on their humanity. True, there is all sorts of religious extremism all over the place, but the reason for this partly has to do with the fascist attitudes and language of absolutism coming from Washington. It's challenging for people outside of America that Bush was re-elected. It means we're all going to have to work a lot harder to understand what so many more Americans than we thought really want. It's an identity shift in our minds about America and maybe for many Americans as well. I don't work the future - I don't want to know what's coming. I don't feel I need any guarantees. There's such an effort to try and explain people. I sometimes think I was always left-wing. I know that sounds completely crazy, but I do know that I asked questions when I was about four, and I remember noticing that I wasn't getting an answer, and I remember it annoying me. Like why when we went to church on Sunday were we sitting upstairs and the people we'd been playing with the day before were sitting downstairs. And I noticed that my brothers were not asking these questions. I was aware that I was being embarrassing. You're always playing yourself. It's all autobiography, whatever you're doing. It's using them as a kind of prism through which to throw something real about yourself, or something relaxed at least. Because the last thing you want is to look like you're acting. I think I enjoy my work now even more simply because it's even easier than it was. It sounds sacrilegious to say that anything's a delight when you're away from your children, but the truth is that it is refreshing to only have yourself to dress in the morning, and to lie diagonally across the bed. Making films, going round the world on tour - all these crazy things that were so difficult before are so much easier than breastfeeding twins for 14 months that frankly it is a delight. In order for the story to move forward, the character has to do certain things. You don't have to be anything but interested in telling the story. I don't love the theatre. I'm just not one of them. I am a soldier. I live a soldier's life when I'm working. That's how it feels to me, except I've got a slightly greater chance of survival. [On the Oscar statuette] I have an American agent who is the spitting image of this. Really truly, the same shape head and, it has to be said, the buttocks.<br>

Mini Biography<br>
Daniel Michael Blake Day-Lewis was born in London, England, the second child of Cecil Day-Lewis (Poet Laureate of England) and his second wife, Jill Balcon . His maternal grandfather was Sir Michael Balcon , an important figure in the history of British cinema, head of the famous Ealing Studios. His older sister, Tamasin Day-Lewis , is a documentary filmmaker. Daniel was educated at Sevenoaks School in Kent, which he despised, and the more progressive Bedales in Petersfield, which he adored. He studied acting at the Bristol Old Vic School. Daniel made his film debut in Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971), but then acted on stage with the Bristol Old Vic and Royal Shakespeare Companies and did not appear on screen again until 1982, when he landed his first adult role, a bit part in Gandhi (1982). He also appeared on British TV that year in _Frost in May (1982) (TV)_ and How Many Miles to Babylon? (1982) (TV). Notable theatrical performances include Another Country (1982-83), Dracula (1984), and The Futurists (1986). His first major supporting role in a feature film was in The Bounty (1984), quickly followed by My Beautiful Laundrette (1985) and A Room with a View (1985). The latter two films opened in New York on the same day, offering audiences and critics evidence of his remarkable range and establishing him as a major talent. The New York Film Critics named him Best Supporting Actor for those performances. In 1986, he appeared on stage in Richard Eyre 's The Futurists and on television in Eyre's production of The Insurance Man (1986) (TV). He also had a small role in a British/French film, Nanou (1986). In 1987 he assumed leading-man status in Philip Kaufman 's The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988), followed by a comedic role in the unsuccessful Stars and Bars (1988). His brilliant performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan 's _My Left Foot (1989)_ won him numerous award s, including The Academy Award for best actor. He returned to the stage to work again with Eyre, as Hamlet at the National Theater, but was forced to leave the production close to the end of its run because of exhaustion, and has not appeared on stage since. He took a hiatus from film as well until 1992, when he starred in The Last of the Mohicans (1992), a film that met with mixed reviews but was a great success at the box office. He worked with American director Martin Scorsese in The Age of Innocence (1993) in 1994. Subsequently, he teamed again with Jim Sheridan to star in In the Name of the Father (1993), a critically acclaimed performance that earned him another Academy Award nomination. His next project was in the role of John Proctor in father-in-law Arthur Miller 's play The Crucible (1996), directed by Nicholas Hytner .<br>

Trivia<br>
Ranked #25 in Empire (UK) magazine's "The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time" list (October 1997). Moving to County Wicklow, Ireland, he assumed Irish citizenship (1993). Lived together with Isabelle Adjani , who gave birth to their son Gabriel-Kane Day-Lewis on 9 April 1995, from 1989 to 1994. Brother of Tamasin Day-Lewis . Chosen by People magazine as one of the "50 Most Beautiful People" in the world (1990). Chosen by Empire magazine as one of the "100 Sexiest Stars" in film history (#11) (1995). Several times offered and turned down the role of Aragorn (Strider) in Peter Jackson 's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Son-in-law of playwright Arthur Miller . According to Harvey Weinstein , Day-Lewis was taking time off to work as a cobbler in Florence, Italy when Weinstein, director Martin Scorsese and star Leonardo DiCaprio lured him into coming back to New York "on false pretenses" so they could persuade him to accept lead role in Gangs of New York (2002). Describes himself as "a lifelong study of evasion." According to Gangs of New York (2002) co-star John C. Reilly , Day- Lewis got sick during shooting in Italy, refusing to trade his character's threadbare coat for a warmer coat because the warmer coat did not exist in the 19th century; doctors finally forced him to take antibiotics. Announced that he will star in Rose and the Snake, co-written and directed by his wife, Rebecca Miller . The film was later renamed The Ballad of Jack and Rose (2005). (25 February 2003). Has three sons: Gabriel-Kane Day-Lewis (born on 9 April 1995), Ronan Cal Day-Lewis (born on 14 June 1998) and Cashel Blake Day-Lewis (born in May 2002). Chosen by People magazine as one of the "50 Most Beautiful People" in the world (2003). Is a skilled woodworker in addition to being able to make his living as a cobbler. He listened to Eminem to get into an angry, self-righteous frame of mind as Bill the Butcher while shooting Gangs of New York (2002). Not only do he and Michelle Pfeiffer share a birthday, but both were married on the same day, albeit three years apart. He was Jonathan Demme 's first choice for the part of Andrew Beckett in Philadelphia (1993). He turned the part down to work on In the Name of the Father (1993) and Tom Hanks was cast in Philadelphia (1993) instead. Day-Lewis earned an Oscar nomination for best actor in In the Name of the Father (1993), but Hanks won the best actor Oscar for Philadelphia (1993), the part Day-Lewis turned down. Always quiet and introverted, he said that he was not popular in school and was mocked as an outsider while growing up in England, partially because he was of half-Jewish/half-Irish stock. The upside was that, instead of socializing, he developed a rich fantasy life that later helped him to delve so deeply into his characters. He was the first of three consecutive British actors to win the Oscar for Best Actor in a leading role, Jeremy Irons being next and Anthony Hopkins the third. Each of them coincidentally won at their first nomination in the Academy Awards. In The Crucible (1996) Joan Allen plays his wife. In The Boxer (1997) Emily Watson plays his wife. Both have played Reba McLain. Allen played the part in Manhunter (1986), Watson played the part in the remake, Red Dragon (2002). Was considered for the role of Jesus Christ in The Passion of the Christ (2004), but director Mel Gibson thought he looked "too European" and the part instead went to James Caviezel . He lived apart from his wife Rebecca Miller while she was directing him in The Ballad of Jack and Rose (2005). This is in keeping with his habit of being isolated while in character and shooting a film, which is in part the reason he is hesitant to take more film work. Frequently called the "English Robert De Niro ." Early in his career, Day-Lewis recently referred to De Niro as his champion. Shares his birthday with Uma Thurman and comedian Jerry Seinfeld . Considered doing an adaptation of "Rose and the Snake" in the early 1990s, but the project fell through. After marrying Rebecca Miller , she convinced him to take the lead role and directed him in the adaptation The Ballad of Jack and Rose (2005). After Michael Madsen was found to be unavailable for the part, Day-Lewis tried to get the role of Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction (1994), one of the few times he actively pursued a part. However, by that point in the casting, Quentin Tarantino had John Travolta in mind for the part. Hated being at Sevenoaks School so much that he ran away. While filming Gangs of New York (2002) he rarely got out of character and would talk with a New York accent the whole day and would be sharpening his knives at lunch. His performance as Christy Brown in _My Left Foot (1989)_ is ranked #11 on Premiere Magazine's 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006). His performance as Bill "The Butcher" Cutting in Gangs of New York (2002) is ranked #53 on Premiere Magazine's 100 Greatest Performances of All Time (2006). Grandson of Michael Balcon . Born to Nicholas Blake (aka Cecil Day-Lewis) and his second wife Jill Balcon , he lost his father at the age of 15. Appears in the novel "That Must Be Yoshino". Turned down leading role of Steven Soderbergh film Solaris (2002). The role instead went to George Clooney . While filming The Ballad of Jack and Rose (2005) on Prince Edward Island, Canada, Day-Lewis lived alone in a hut on the beach, away from his wife, director Rebecca Miller , and their children. Late in the run of the 1989 production of Hamlet at the National Theatre in London, he reported that he had a strange sensation that he was talking to his father, who died of pancreatic cancer when Daniel was 15. Unnerved, he walked off the stage and never returned. He still doesn't like to talk about it. During The Last of the Mohicans (1992) he built a canoe, learned to track and skin animals, and perfected the use of a 12-pound flintlock gun, which he took everywhere he went, even to a Christmas dinner. Dedicated his 2008 SAG Award to Heath Ledger who was one of his favorite actors. Holds dual citizenship - British and Irish. Was director Alex Cox 's second choice for the role of Sid Vicious in Sid and Nancy (1986). Gary Oldman got the part. Supports Millwall Football Club. Trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School where colleagues included Miranda Richardson and Greta Scacchi . Owns homes in the US and Ireland. Got to know his future wife Rebecca Miller while working on the film version of her father Arthur Miller 's play "The Crucible". The first non-American actor to win two Academy Awards for best actor.<br>

Personal Quotes<br>
(on acting) "If I weren't allowed this outlet, there wouldn't be a place for me in society." I suppose I have a highly developed capacity for self-delusion, so it's no problem for me to believe I'm somebody else. On whether or not he will act in films more often in the future: "Nothing happened over the course of making Gangs of New York that made me think, 'Why don't I do this more often?'" In every actor's life, there is a moment when they ask themselves, 'Is it really seemly for me to still be doing this?' (On Scorsese) Martin doesn't have to convince me about anything. I can only say that I would wish for any one of my colleagues to have the experience of working with Marty once in their lifetime. If you get it twice, it's a privilege that you don't necessarily look for but you certainly don't try to avoid. Life comes first. What I see in the characters, I first try to see in life. The West has always been the epicenter of possibility. One of the ways we forge against mortality is to head west. It's to do with catching the sun before it slips behind the horizon. We all keep moving toward the sun, wishing to get the last ray of hope before it sets. (on playing Jack Slevin in The Ballad of Jack and Rose (2005)) I was, as always, wary of taking on the role. This was a man whose soul was torn, and once you've adopted that kind of internal conflict, it's difficult to quiet. On disengaging from a character after filming: "There's a terrible sadness. The last day of shooting is surreal. Your mind, your body, your spirit are not in any way prepared to accept that this experience is coming to an end. In the months that follow the finish of a film, you feel profound emptiness. You've devoted so much of your time to unleashing, in an unconscious way, some sort of spiritual turmoil, and even if it's uncomfortable, no part of you wishes to leave that character behind. The sense of bereavement is such that it can take years before you can put it to rest. Before I start a film, there is always a period where I think, I'm not sure I can do this again. I remember that before I was going to start There Will Be Blood (2007), I wondered why I had said yes. When Martin Scorsese told me about Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York (2002), I wanted to change places with that man. But even then, I did not say yes right away. I kept thinking, I'm not sure I can do this again. (on seeing his face in Hollywood posters for The Last of the Mohicans (1992)) That was, and will always be, difficult for me. The work itself is never anything but pure pleasure, but there's an awful lot of peripheral stuff that I find it hard to be surrounded by. I like things to be swift, because the energy you have is concentrated and can be fleeting. The great machinery of film can work against that. I have never had a positive reaction to all the stuff that supposedly promotes the film. The thought of it will make me hesitate to do any films at all. (on learning to box for The Boxer (1997)) I wanted to see if I loved the sport, because if I didn't love the sport, I wouldn't want to tell the story. At its best, boxing is very pure. It requires resilience and heart and self-belief even after it's been knocked out of you. It's a certain kind of a test. And it's hard: the training alone will kill you. And that's before people start giving you a dig. Playing the part of Christy Brown left me with a sense of setting myself on a course, of trying to achieve something that was utterly out of reach. (after filming The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988)) I was hopelessly at sea. I was extremely unhappy most of the time. I think I probably felt I'd made a fundamental error in agreeing to do that movie even though it was the part and the film that everyone wanted to do. And God help us, that is, in itself, a reason not to do something. (while filming My Left Foot: The Story of Christy Brown (1989)) I needed - and I still need - to create a particular environment. I need to find the right kind of silence or light or noise. Whatever is necessary - and it is always different. I know it sounds a little fussy and a little ridiculous, but finding your own rhythm is one of the most important things you can discover about yourself. And you have to observe it. As actors, we're all encouraged to feel that each job is the last job. They plant some little electrode in your head at an early stage and you think, Be grateful, be grateful, be grateful. So, it's not without a sense of gratitude that I work. But I couldn't do this work at all unless I did it in my own rhythm. It became a choice between stopping and taking the time I needed. Why would I want to play middle-aged middle-class Englishmen? [T]here's a quality of wildness that exists in Ireland that coincides with utter solitude. I've managed to create a sense of banishment in so many different areas of my life. I live in Ireland, not England. I make films in America. And now I'm banished from the theater because I've slagged it off so much. And I did the unspeakable thing of fleeing from 'Hamlet.' (on acting school) For a few years at school I tried to play the roles they wanted me to play, but it became less and less interesting to ponce around the place. Even now, when I sometimes think of doing a play, I think of rehearsal rooms and people hugging and everyone talking over cups of coffee because they are nervous. It's both very touching and it makes me a little nauseous and claustrophobic. Too much talk. I don't rehearse at all in film if I can help it. In talking a character through, you define it. And if you define it, you kill it dead. Laurence Olivier might have been a much better actor on film if he hadn't had that flippant attitude. [He] was a remarkable actor, but he was entirely missing the point consistently. He felt that film was an inferior form. The thing that Konstantin Stanislavski lays out is how you do the thing the first time every time - 1,000 times. That's the idea you're always searching for. (on working as a teen-age extra in Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971)) I was just a local kid. I got to come out of the church, the same church where I sang in the choir, and scratch up a row of cars - a Jag, a Bentley - parked in front. I thought, I get paid for this! Years later, I saw the director, John Schlesinger , at the Edinburgh festival, where we were showing My Beautiful Laundrette (1985). I play a hooligan punk in that too. I said to Schlesinger, 'I guess I haven't progressed much.' I came from the educated middle class but I identified with the working classes. Those were the people I looked up to. The lads whose fathers worked on the docks or in shipping yards or were shopkeepers. I knew that I wasn't part of that world, but I was intrigued by it. They had a different way of communicating. People who delight in conversation are often using that as a means to not say what is on their minds. When I became interested in theater, the work I admired was being done by working-class writers. It was often about the inarticulate. I later saw that same thing in Robert De Niro 's early work - it was the most sublime struggle of a man trying to express himself. There was such poetry in that for me. (on obtaining Irish citizenship) I dare say it was still considered to be an abandonment of England A betrayal! A heresy! It is not expected that someone from my background will leave England. But I've committed so many heresies that there's no sense in not making the final gesture. (on visiting the west of Ireland every year since childhood) From the day we arrived here, my sense of Ireland's importance has never diminished. Everything here seemed exotic to us. Just the sound of the west of Ireland in a person's voice can affect me deeply. (on researching his role as Plainview in There Will Be Blood (2007)) I like to learn about things. It was just a great time trying to conceive of the impossibility of that thing. I didn't know anything about mining at the turn of the century in America. My boarding school in Kent didn't exactly teach that. (on researching his role as Plainview in There Will Be Blood (2007)) Back then men would get the fever. They would keep digging, always with the idea that next time they'll throw the dice and the money will fall out of the sky. It killed a lot of men, it broke others, still more were reduced to despair and poverty, but they still believed in the promise of the West. (on researching his role as Plainview in There Will Be Blood (2007)) I read a lot of correspondence dating from that period. Decent middle-class lives with wives and children were abandoned to pursue this elusive possibility. They were bank clerks and shipping agents and teachers. They all fled West for a sniff of cheap money. And they made it up as they went along. No one knew how to drill for oil. Initially, they scooped it out of the ground in saucepans. It was man at his most animalistic, sifting through filth to find bright, sparkly things. It was always assumed that the classics were a good line of work for me because I had a decent voice and the right nose. But anybody who comes from an essentially cynical European society is going to be bewitched by the sheer enthusiasm of the New World. And in America, the articulate use of language is often regarded with suspicion. Especially in the West. Look at the president. He could talk like an educated New Englander if he chose to. Instead, he holds his hands like a man who swings an ax. George W. Bush understands, very astutely, that many of the people who are going to vote for him would regard him less highly if he knew how to put words together. He would no longer be one of them. In Europe, the tradition is one of oratory. But in America, a man's man is never spendthrift with words. This, of course, is much more appealing in the movies than it is in politics. (replying to a compliment on his articulation) I am more greatly moved by people who struggle to express themselves. Maybe it's a middle-class British hang-up, but I prefer the abstract concept of incoherence in the face of great feeling to beautiful, full sentences that convey little emotion. (on applying to theater school, the Bristol Old Vic) I picked just one because then it would be a sign from the gods if it was not meant to be. (on his reluctance to expose the mechanics of his acting process) It's not that I want to pull the shutters down. It's just that people have such a misconception about what it is I do. They think the character comes from staying in the wheelchair or being locked in the jail or whatever extravagant thing they choose to focus their fantasies on. Somehow, it always seems to have a self-flagellatory aspect to it. But that's just the superficial stuff. Most of the movies that I do are leading me toward a life that is utterly mysterious to me. My chief goal is to find a way to make that life meaningful to other people. I was deeply unsettled by the script [of There Will Be Blood (2007)]. For me, that is a sure sign. If you remain unsettled by a piece of writing, it means you are not watching the story from the outside; you've already taken a step toward it. When I'm drawn to something, I take a resolute step backward, and I ask myself if I can really serve this story as well as it needs to be served. If I don't think I can do that, no matter how appealing, I will decline. What finally takes over, what took over with this movie, is an illusion of inevitability. I think: Can this really be true? Is this happening to me again? Is there no way to avoid this? My love for American movies was like a secret that I carried around with me. I always knew I could straddle different worlds. I'd grown up in two different worlds and if you can grow up in two different worlds, you can occupy four. Or six. Why put a limit on it? I used to go to all-night screenings of ( Clint Eastwood )'s movies. I'd stagger out at 5 in the morning, trying to be loose-limbed and mean and taciturn. Where I come from, it was a heresy to say you wanted to be in movies, leave alone American movies. We were all encouraged to believe that the classics of the theater were the fiery hoops through which you'd have to pass if you were going to have any self-esteem as a performer. It never occurred to me that that was the case. One of the great privileges of having grown up in a middle-class literary English household, but having gone to school in the front lines in Southeast London, was that I became half-street-urchin and half-good-boy at home. I knew that dichotomy was possible. England is obsessed with where you came from, and they are determined to keep you in that place, be it in a drawing room or in the gutter. The great tradition of liberalism in England is essentially a sponge that absorbs all possibility of change. America looked different to me: the idea of America as a place of infinite possibilities was defined for me through the movies. I'm glad I did the classical work that I did, but it just wasn't for me. I'm a little bit perverse, and I just hate doing the thing that's the most obvious. I saw Taxi Driver (1976) five or six times in the first week, and I was astonished by its sheer visceral beauty. I just kept going back - I didn't know America, but that was a glimpse of what America might be, and I realized that, contrary to expectation, I wanted to tell American stories. I don't particularly like westerns as a genre, but I do love certain westerns. High Noon (1952) means a lot to me - I love the purity and the honesty, I love Gary Cooper in that film, the idea of the last man standing. I do not like John Wayne : I find it hard to watch him. I just never took to him. And I don't like James Stewart as a cowboy. I love him, but just not as a cowboy; Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) is one of my favorite films. I love Frank Capra . I love Preston Sturges . But we're talking about westerns. ... I have always admired Clint Eastwood 's westerns. The spaghetti westerns were a great discovery. And Pale Rider (1985). As a child, the John Ford film _Cheyenne Autumn_ made a big impression on me. And _Five Easy Pieces_. It's not really a western, but it is about the possibilities that can be found in the West. Jack Nicholson is sublime in that film, just sublime. It's the most stultifying portrait of middle-class life. You want to flee from that world and head anywhere less civilized. Which is, of course, the appeal of the West: It's not tamed yet. [on creating a characterization] The intention is always the same. To try to discover life in its entirety, or at least create for yourself the illusion that you have, which might give you some chance of convincing other people of it. It's the same thing each time, but it requires totally different work in the process of achieving that. You are set on a path that's strewn with obstacles, but getting over them is the joy of the work. So it's impossible to think in terms of difficulty: it all seems utterly impossible, but the pleasure is in trying to forge ahead anyway. My ambition for many years was to be involved in work that was utterly compelling to me, regardless of the consequences. But I worried a lot as a young man about where such and such a thing might take me; you're encouraged to think that way. You're supposed to build a career for yourself. But there's no part of me that was able to do that. And thank God I was able to recognize it before I sort of went grey with anxiety. For my sense of continuity, I suppose I work in a certain way. But it goes beyond that. It's really about the sense of joy you have in having worked hard to imagine and discover and - one hopes - to create a world, an illusion of a world that other people might believe in because you believe in it yourself, a form of self-delusion. After achieving that, it seems far crazier to jump in and out of that world that you've gone to such pains to create. And it wouldn't be my wish to do that, because I enjoy being in there. - On why he takes long breaks between films. Whenever we reach what we think are the boundaries of our endurance, you know ten minutes later you're thinking: I could have done that - like in any athletic pursuit - I could have gone further than that; I could have jumped higher. I am rather surprised that I haven't made more stories about my own country but it is a mistake to suggest that the biggest influence on my life in terms of movies has been America. It was and remains Ken Loach and his whole body of work, not that I have ever worked with him. There is something unique and pure about the way he works, without a taint on it. His beliefs have remained unwavering since he made Cathy Come Home. I do have dual citizenship, but I think of England as my country. I miss London very much but I couldn't live there because there came a time when I needed to be private and was forced to be public by the press. I couldn't deal with it. I was very influenced by Ken Loach's work from the moment I saw "Kes" when I was a kid. It still remains for me one of the most powerful pieces of work ever. Before that, there was "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning", "This Sporting Life" and "The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner", which all expressed a new British social realism. Undoubtedly, they opened up the possibility of examining British life in a new way. That was probably the most important film experience I had. I have no illusion about the fact that I'm an Englishman living in Ireland. Even though I do straddle both worlds and I'm very proud to be able to carry both passports. But I do know where I come from. I particularly miss south-east London - the front-lines of Deptford and Lewisham and New Cross and Charlton - because that's my patch. [On accepting the best actor Oscar for 'There Will be Blood'] This sprang like a sapling out of the mad, beautiful head of Paul Thomas Anderson.<br>
