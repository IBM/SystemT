Published: March 10, 2009<br>
<br>
Version: 1.0<br>
General Information<br>
Executive Summary<br>
<br>
This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel. The most serious vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted EMF or WMF image file from an affected system.<br>
<br>
This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, Affected and Non-Affected Software, in this section.<br>
<br>
The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by validating input passed from user mode through the kernel component of GDI, correcting the way that the kernel validates handles, and changing the way that the Windows kernel handles specially crafted invalid pointers. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, Vulnerability Information.<br>
<br>
Recommendation. The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294781.<br>
<br>
For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the Microsoft Update service.<br>

	<br>
Windows Kernel Input Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0081<br>
<br>
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Windows kernel due to improper validation of input passed from user mode through the kernel component of GDI. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.<br>
<br>
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see CVE-2009-0081.<br>
	<br>
Mitigating Factors for Windows Kernel Input Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0081<br>
<br>
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:<br>
Â•	<br>
<br>
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.<br>
Top of sectionTop of section<br>
	<br>
Workarounds for Windows Kernel Input Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0081<br>
<br>
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:<br>
Â•	<br>
<br>
Turn off metafile processing by modifying the registry<br>
Customers who have applied the security update associated with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS07-017 or customers using Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 can disable metafile processing by modifying the registry. This setting will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.<br>
<br>
To modify the key, follow these steps:<br>
<br>
Note Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.<br>
<br>
1.<br>
	<br>
<br>
Click Start, click Run, type Regedit in the Open box, and then click OK.<br>
<br>
2.<br>
	<br>
<br>
Locate and then click the following registry subkey:<br>
<br>
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\GRE_Initialize<br>
<br>
3.<br>
	<br>
<br>
On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD.<br>
<br>
4.<br>
	<br>
<br>
Type DisableMetaFiles, and then press ENTER.<br>
<br>
5.<br>
	<br>
<br>
On the Edit menu, click Modify to modify the DisableMetaFiles registry entry.<br>
<br>
6.<br>
	<br>
<br>
In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK.<br>
<br>
7.<br>
	<br>
<br>
Exit Registry Editor.<br>
<br>
8.<br>
	<br>
<br>
Restart the computer.<br>
<br>
Impact of workaround. Turning off processing of metafiles may cause the appearance of the output from software or system components to decrease in quality. Turning off processing of metafiles may also cause software or system components to fail completely. This workaround has been identified to have a potentially significant functionality impact and should be evaluated and tested carefully to determine its applicability.<br>
<br>
Examples include the following:<br>
Â•	<br>
<br>
You cannot print on the computer.<br>
Â•	<br>
<br>
Some applications on the computer may be unable to display Clipart.<br>
Â•	<br>
<br>
Some scenarios that involve OLE rendering may break. This most often occurs when the object server is not active.<br>
<br>
For more information on this setting read Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 941835.<br>
<br>

FAQ for Windows Kernel Input Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0081<br>
<br>
What is the scope of the vulnerability? <br>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.<br>
<br>
What causes the vulnerability? <br>
The Windows kernel does not properly validate input passed from user mode through the kernel component of GDI.<br>
<br>
What is the Windows kernel? <br>
The Windows kernel is the core of the operating system. It provides system level services such as device management and memory management, it allocates processor time to processes, and it manages error handling.<br>
<br>
What is GDI? <br>
The Microsoft Windows graphics device interface (GDI) enables applications to use graphics and formatted text on both the video display and the printer. Windows-based applications do not access the graphics hardware directly. Instead, GDI interacts with device drivers on behalf of applications. For more information about GDI, visit the Windows GDI Start Page.<br>
<br>
What are Windows Metafile (WMF) and Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image formats?<br>
A WMF image is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system.<br>
<br>
An EMF image is a 32-bit format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. This format is an improvement over the Windows Metafile Format and contains extended features.<br>
<br>
For more information about image types and formats, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 320314. Additional information about these file formats is also available at the MSDN Library Web Site.<br>
<br>
What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do? <br>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.<br>
<br>
How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability? <br>
For remote code execution, this vulnerability requires that a user view a specially crafted image file. This vulnerability may also be exploited by an attacker logged on to the local system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over the affected system.<br>
<br>
In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an e-mail with a specially crafted EMF or WMF image file embedded in it to the user and convincing the user to view or preview the e-mail. An attacker could also embed a specially crafted EMF or WMF image file in an Office document and convince the user to open the file.<br>
<br>
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an EMF or WMF image file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.<br>
<br>
What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability? <br>
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.<br>
<br>
What does the update do? <br>
The update addresses the vulnerability by validating input passed from user mode through the kernel component of GDI.<br>
<br>
When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed? <br>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.<br>
<br>
When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited? <br>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.<br>
