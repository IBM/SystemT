<br>
	Why has the w3 homepage changed<br>
	The homepage is designed to further advance the foundation of profiled delivery of content, as well as new tools and applications to help users manage their workflow, access and share information, collaborate, leverage the organization's knowledge base and create a more open culture. A great deal more content is available that users can access directly from their homepage which is divided into mini-pages called "portlets."<br>
<br>
<br>
	<br>
<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
<br>
	What is a portlet<br>
	Portlets are customized content areas designed to deliver personalized information to users based on their profile. (To experience all that each portlet has to offer you must create your w3 profile. Go to Profile Settings , scroll down to Personal Information and click on "Modify." Next, select your preferences. When you are finished, hit "Submit." Your w3 homepage will be tailored to your particular needs and interests.)<br>
	<br>
<br>
	Each homepage portlet is based on a particular type of activity (e.g., reading the news, or carrying out HR-related processes, or finding job-related information) and offers added functionality 혰 some more than others. For example, most portlets can be minimized (its text and graphics are hidden) and maximized (expanded to a full screen view). All users, regardless of whether they have created a w3 profile, will see information in each portlet. Profiled users, however, will experience significantly richer 혰 and more 혰 content based on their profile settings.<br>

	<br>
<br>
	<br>
<br>
	What are the portlets<br>
	Currently, there are nine portlets available for display on the w3 homepage. Briefly, they are:<br>
	<br>
	News : Provides a wide range of news content about IBM and its competitors.<br>
	You and IBM : Your gateway to Human Resources information.<br>
<br>
	Working Knowledge : Here, you'll find timely, business-focused resources based on your profile. (This portlet is available only to profiled users.)<br>
	Essential Links : Your favorite w3 or Internet sites.<br>
	Search : Improved functionality lets you find what you need on w3, BluePages, and the ibm.com 혰 all from one place.<br>
	Market Report : Information about IBM's stock and the performance of its competitors.<br>
<br>
	Scorecard : Metrics-based information about IBM's performance and strategic priorities.<br>
	IBM Forums : Your link to IBM's many discussion forums.<br>
	Selling for IBM : Your gateway to the Selling for IBM intranet site. (This portlet is available only to users who have selected a selling category in their profile.)<br>
<br>
	<br>
	For more information about each portlet, go to its corresponding help page listed below. <br>

<br>
	What do the title bar icons mean<br>
<br>
Each portlet has a title bar. In each title bar you will see icons. (Some portlets' title bars contain more icons than others.)  Each icon is associated with a function as follows:<br>
<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
<br>
	<br>
<br>
	'Edit' Icon<br>
	When you click on the edit icon in the title bar of a portlet, you will be taken to a page where you can edit the content for that portlet.<br>
<br>
	'Help' Icon By clicking on the question mark in the title bar of a portlet, you will be taken to its corresponding Help page.<br>
<br>
	'Minimize' Icon This lets you minimize the a portlet on the homepage. Click on it to collapse the content of the section. It will remove the portlet's text and graphics. All you will see is the portlet's title bar, which will include a restore icon of two overlapping screens.<br>
<br>
<br>
	'Restore' Icon An icon of two screens in the title bar of a portlet indicates that the portlet is currently minimized (its text and graphics are hidden) or maximized (full screen). To restore the portlet to its default view, click on the restore icon.<br>
<br>
	'Maximize' Icon This lets you maximize the portlet on the homepage. Click on it to expand the section to fill the screen. In its maximized view, the portlet's title bar will include a restore icon of two overlapping screens.<br>

	<br>
<br>
<br>
	What is the technology behind the new homepage<br>
	The homepage is built on IBM's WebSphere, which uses a combination of Java Server Pages (.jsp) and servlets to deliver new functionality. The infrastructure is designed to use traditional API's, as well as Web services-based methods, which will increase over time as new services are published to the w3 Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) server. Under UDDI, all business units will be able to register in the intranet-based services directory to make their offerings widely available. Since IBM provides technical and business services through industry standards like SOAP and XML over HTTP, such availability will mean higher reuse and lower expense-to-revenue ratios. The portlets' mini Web-based applications are treated as independent components and can be developed, deployed and maintained as separate entities. With e-Workplace, the w3 team is establishing a base application platform that will allow added functionality through new portlets, without the need to redesign the site for every addition or update.<br>
