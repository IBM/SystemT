Hi all,
I've added some hooks for telling an operator graph to stop processing and return what results it has.  The procedure for doing so is:
1. (From the watchdog thread) Interrupt the thread that is running the graph by calling Thread.interrupt()
2. (From the main thread) Once the thread detects the interrupt, an InterruptedException will be thrown; catch the exception in your top-level code and collect any available results.
3. Call OperatorGraphRunner.resetGraph() to clean up any internal state before your next call to pushDoc().
Note that Thread.interrupt() is an *asynchronous* call; it may take some time before the main thread realizes it's been interrupted.
I've checked the code into AnnotationAlgebra and updated SystemT.jar in code yellow.
There is some example code in the methods SQLEnronTests.watchdogTest() and SQLEnronTests.neWatchdogTest().
Fred
