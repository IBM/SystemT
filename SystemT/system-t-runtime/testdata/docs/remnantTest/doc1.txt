Tim,
We crawl everything in the mail database including  email and calendar entries.In fact as you may have noticed from the UI we hide the calendar entries by default and show them in the search results only if asked to do so by the user. 
I will have to test how the TODO items show up when we crawl your mail DB and if indeed they are getting skipped for some reason. Let me do that investigation and get back to you.
