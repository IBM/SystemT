I don't think it will be a problem, Sriram, and let me make the following observations:
I don't see anything in the OSS db related to javacc, likely because nobody is distributing javacc itself, but only the output.
When you complete the COO, you should simply identify javacc as a development tool you used, and not as an OSS dependency, similar in the way you would identify Eclipse if you used it as an IDE but are not distributing Eclipse itself.
Are there any notices (e.g., Sun copyrights) in the files generated by javacc that you're transferring to Lotus?
The current javacc license, BSD-style, doesn't explicitly say anything about claims on the output. A worst case scenario is that a SWG IP Law attorney may want to treat the output as the same license as javacc itself. In either case, this shouldn't be a problem. A previous javacc license, found here,  
http://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/lapis/doc/legal/JavaCC-license.html
, explicitly states the following:
DEVELOPED PRODUCTS 
You may use the Software to generate software program(s) (""DevelopedPrograms""). Sun claims no rights in or to the Developed Programs.

Re: Fw: Some more questions for a new COO for transfer to Lotus
Joe
I will be helping with the preparation of the COO for the transfer of Lotus. The primary question seems to be around the use of javacc as stated in your earlier email below. We can confirm that we are only using the output of javacc and not distributing either javacc or any of its runtime libs. 
Given this, is it going to be a problem getting our use of javacc output into the COO or is that something that IBM has already covered? Thanks

Re: Fw: Some more questions for a new COO for transfer to Lotus
Hi Shiv,
What's the status of this, and is there anything you need from me?
My understanding is that you're using javacc. The question I'd have is, are you distributing javacc itself (or any of its runtime libs) with your code, or are you only distributing the output of javacc (since javacc is a compiler compiler)? I'd then have to look at the javacc license to determine whether or not the output from javacc is considered open source.
Thanks, Joe

Re: Fw: Some more questions for a new COO for transfer to Lotus
The most important question for the near term is do you have any Open Source/3rd party code?

I know Gail is busy, so I can handle this one.
This is for inclusion and external distribution in the Lotus Notes 8.01 product.
It will be part of the installer that is shipped.
The form I included below is part of the COO ""relay"" where you certify your piece and we sign off on it.

Re: Some more questions for a new OCC for transfer to Lotus
I'll have to look into it more, Shiv (I'm in NY until Thursday), b/c it may have been previously cleared by RATL, and I need to ask a question about exactly what you're using from javacc (e.g., just the output of the compiler?), but one initial question I have is: Is this for transfer to SWG for inclusion in a product, and they'll be doing the external distribution? If so, then we can partially clear it, but SWG will ultimately have to sign off on it, so you should first ask them (e.g., your SWG catcher, or I can ask my SWG counterpart) if they're going to be willing to use it in product.

Some more questions for a new OCC for transfer to Lotus
Hi Joe ..
We are back in business. Based on our previous software we are presently in the process of transferring code to Lotus and of course we need a new COO.  The first question (potentially of many)  is can we use javacc V 4.0 ? 
thanks,
-shiv
