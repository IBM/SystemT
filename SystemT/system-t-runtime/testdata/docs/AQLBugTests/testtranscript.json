{"label":"0:Bobby","text":"Okay I think that’s it. I think we’re being recorded. Another introduction is in order, we have a new member of the extended team today (Greg Wallraff) is in the room is a chemist by training and he has been reading up a lot on sequencing especially the laboratory side of sequencing and he may be able to shed some light on how our data connects back to the sequencing protocols that Bart is using. Greg you want to say hello?"}
{"label":"1:Greg Wallraff","text":"Hello."}
{"label":"2:Bobby","text":"For the people in the room we have myself - remote, we have (Cheryl K.) - remote. We have (Niina Haiminen) in Watson, New York so also remote, and (Simone) is on the phone as well. Okay, how is everyone?"}
{"label":"3:Man","text":"Pretty good."}
{"label":"4:Man","text":"Great."}
{"label":"5:Man","text":"Good."}
{"label":"6:Bobby","text":"I was - oh my gosh (unintelligible) I was going to - I think that the main purpose of today’s meeting is to get ready for the meetings that will be - whereby results will be communicated with (Mars) next Thursday. Um, let me just first say that everybody is, of course, invited to participate in that meeting in any way that they can. If you’re remote we’ll make arrangements to be on the phone otherwise in person at the ADLab.\nSo I sent out a single slide, which is the beginning of a slide that could collect - to collect results, and it can be kind of rough in the beginning and then we’ll refine it as we go along. And I wanted to open it up actually to everyone to take a look at that, that slide. Unfortunately I can’t talk and try to share the screen at the same time so, um let’s see if I can - just take a moment to pause."}
{"label":"7:Ninna","text":"Well we have the slide if you want to talk about it. We can open it."}
{"label":"8:Bobby","text":"Yeah, I was hoping to edit on the fly. Entire display..."}
{"label":"9:Stefan","text":"Did you send it (unintelligible), I don’t see it."}
{"label":"10:Bobby","text":"I sent it about five minutes ago, but if you don’t see it I’m projecting it now also."}
{"label":"11:Stefan","text":"Oh okay."}
{"label":"12:Bobby","text":"Can anybody see what’s on the screen?"}
{"label":"13:Jamie","text":"Can you open it up a little bigger?"}
{"label":"14:Bobby","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"15:Bobby","text":"Let’s see here - is it readable?"}
{"label":"16:Jamie","text":"Yeah, now I can see it."}
{"label":"17:Bobby","text":"So at the moment I just have - I want to make sure that we collect, we collet everything that’s been done so far and then, you know, we - so the first thing - the first question now is what have we done. And this was my understanding of what’s been done, but I’m sure that there’s a lot more that I’m missing. Maybe we should just go line by line and people can chime in as soon as they want. I know that we’ve been trimming and filtering on the quality scores. I know that we’ve done BLASTN versus the nucleotide database. We’ve done Diamonds, which is like a BLASTP versus the NR Protein database.\nWe’ve done BLASTN versus a 16S collection from NCBI. We’ve done BLASTN versus a 16S collection provided by the RDP, the ribosome database project. We’ve run RDP Classifier versus the RDP 16S collection. We’ve done some merging of reads using a so-called paradigm dissembler they call (Panda Seek) that’s something that I was doing.\nLikewise I’ve run both tie-two of the reads versus reference genomes so mapping these back to let’s say chicken. We’ve done trinity assembly and something else."}
{"label":"18:Jamie","text":"(Bobby) can I ask a question?"}
{"label":"19:Bobby","text":"Yes."}
{"label":"20:Jamie","text":"On some of these I know we only ran on like 10% of the data."}
{"label":"21:Bobby","text":"Right."}
{"label":"22:Jamie","text":"So could we mark where we - I mean particularly for assembly, ah could we mark what fraction of the data - I mean that could be important right?"}
{"label":"23:Bobby","text":"Yes. Yes. I mean I can capture that in a table or we could make sure that we’re representing the amount of processing correctly that it was on let’s say 10%, 100%."}
{"label":"24:Jamie","text":"Yeah, maybe just parenthetically, even some of the BLASTs was on some percentage of the data, right?"}
{"label":"25:Stefan","text":"Yeah.\n((Crosstalk))"}
{"label":"26:Bobby","text":"That’s right."}
{"label":"27:Jamie","text":"So we’ve never actually done the full data sets."}
{"label":"28:Stefan","text":"We have done..."}
{"label":"29:Jamie","text":"We have?"}
{"label":"30:Stefan","text":"Diamond did the full datasets."}
{"label":"31:Jamie","text":"Diamond did - okay."}
{"label":"32:Stefan","text":"That’s right."}
{"label":"33:Jamie","text":"So let’s have maybe a parenthetic or a color code where we use the full data where use - just for next week."}
{"label":"34:Bobby","text":"I can just take a quick note. 10% for BLAST or not even a percent - 1 million?"}
{"label":"35:Stefan","text":"One million I think - I mean with... um, this one is the full data there - right - cause we..."}
{"label":"36:Bobby","text":"Right. Oh, (finger snap) SortMeRNA that is one of these, isn’t it?"}
{"label":"37:Stefan","text":"Yeah so let’s see. SortMeRNA is - trimming is on the full data, right? Out of trimming if you want SortMeRNA whatever comes out.  But it, most of the data except the bad stuff."}
{"label":"38:Bobby","text":"Well SortMeRNA is giving, ah the 16S right?"}
{"label":"39:Stefan","text":"The input is pretty much everything except the bad stuff, output is small stuff, yes 16S - yeah."}
{"label":"40:Bobby","text":"Right."}
{"label":"41:Stefan","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"42:Bobby","text":"So..."}
{"label":"43:Stefan","text":"(Unintelligible)."}
{"label":"44:Bobby","text":"So...that’s fine. Right."}
{"label":"45:Stefan","text":"In case people don’t know it’s a filter to find the 16S read."}
{"label":"46:Bobby","text":"So then the BLASTN versus nucleotide that was about a million per sample?"}
{"label":"47:Stefan","text":"Okay let’s be clear on that. I know that we did it on the preliminary sample the one we had a few weeks back. I need to check if we did it on all 8 samples that we downloaded last week."}
{"label":"48:Bobby","text":"Okay."}
{"label":"49:Stefan","text":"I know we done it for one of the samples."}
{"label":"50:Bobby","text":"I think it’s not, it’s not too much computation so I think it would be good to have that done."}
{"label":"51:Stefan","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"52:Greg","text":"Can I ask a question - why did you just do 10% and how did you pick the 10% you did? Ten percent was just for speed?"}
{"label":"53:Stefan","text":"Um, okay let’s - which - 10% I think you’re talking about trinity assembly then…"}
{"label":"54:Greg","text":"Well anytime you’ve got…"}
{"label":"55:Bobby","text":"No no, he says BLASTN 1 million. Um…"}
{"label":"56:Stefan","text":"Well no (unintelligible)."}
{"label":"57:Bobby","text":"Yeah (Greg) it’s because it takes a long time."}
{"label":"58:Stefan","text":"Yeah it takes way too long time to run."}
{"label":"59:Greg","text":"Okay then how do you pick the 10% you did - just randomly?"}
{"label":"60:Stefan","text":"[sigh] (David) this is, I’m not sure, I think (David) would know... I think it probably took..."}
{"label":"61:Bobby","text":"I think the picker, go like every 10th or every 20th..."}
{"label":"62:Stefan","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"63:Bobby","text":"or every 30th."}
{"label":"64:Stefan","text":"Not this millions - I think it took the first one million - I seem to remember you saying that."}
{"label":"65:Jamie","text":"He wanted to do it differently but that was what was done so far, as I recall."}
{"label":"66:Stefan","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"67:Bobby","text":"Okay, honestly I don’t, you know, these like little subtleties like how does he pick. Very - I mean I think it’s a minor point at this point."}
{"label":"68:Stefan","text":"Okay."}
{"label":"69:Greg","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"70:Bobby","text":"But (Greg) the answer is that BLASTN is just not really suited to do billions of operations so you pick some small fraction and get an idea of what you’re getting hits to. So, Diamond is fast, so fast that we ran it on full data sets and again (Stefan) was that every sample?"}
{"label":"71:Stefan","text":"Every sample we have Diamond, yeah."}
{"label":"72:Bobby","text":"Oh that’s great."}
{"label":"73:Stefan","text":"Yes that’s - yep."}
{"label":"74:Bobby","text":"(Unintelligible). These I actually had questions on for you (Stefan) - so BLASTN versus a 16S sequence is from NCBI, that is something done?"}
{"label":"75:Stefan","text":"Ah, yes, and it’s the same input that came out of SortMeRNA so it’s a smaller..."}
{"label":"76:Bobby","text":"Okay."}
{"label":"77:Stefan","text":"...input right there."}
{"label":"78:Bobby","text":"Right, but it is in that sense comprehensive."}
{"label":"79:Stefan","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"80:Bobby","text":"Was that for all samples?"}
{"label":"81:Stefan","text":"Ah, yes."}
{"label":"82:Bobby","text":"And then you also ran BLASTN versus other 16S collection like this RDP collection?"}
{"label":"83:Stefan","text":"This one that - I think you’re talking about the RDP and the BLAST database that came out of RDP..."}
{"label":"84:Bobby","text":"Yes..."}
{"label":"85:Stefan","text":"No, I haven’t done that yet."}
{"label":"86:Bobby","text":"Okay. Maybe – okay. But did you do another - you had multiple 16S workflows there."}
{"label":"87:Stefan","text":"Yeah, so these are the three we have is the BLAST - 16S - 16S microbial that NCBI has that’s the first, that’s the one above it right?"}
{"label":"88:Bobby","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"89:Stefan","text":"Uh, BLAST 16S RDP is the database we generated from the RDP database. I haven’t done that..."}
{"label":"90:Bobby","text":"Oh, you have not done that one?"}
{"label":"91:Stefan","text":"Right."}
{"label":"92:Bobby","text":"Okay, which one did you do?"}
{"label":"93:Stefan","text":"RDP classified, the one below it we have done - that’s the RDP out of the box - right - that one we’ve done."}
{"label":"94:Bobby","text":"Okay, yes so what that is indicating is the RDP classifier is looking at 16S genes and the dataset is provided by RDP."}
{"label":"95:Stefan","text":"The database is the RDP out of the box and input is output of SortMeRNA."}
{"label":"96:Bobby","text":"Right, yep, okay. And did we do that for all eight samples?"}
{"label":"97:Stefan","text":"Yes."}
{"label":"98:Bobby","text":"Okay great. And this was something that I was doing on one million reads at the moment and it’s definitely not done. So just to give everyone an idea this (Panda Seek) that was one of these what’s called a paired read aligner.\nIf you can imagine if the reads happen to be - if the fragment that’s being sequenced from the left and from the right is shorter than the read length, so if the read length is 100 and 100 that gives you 200 face pairs. If the fragment was 150 then each of those reads will over-read each other in the middle. They’ll run over each other by 50. And so what this (Panda Seek) does is merge them into a single, a single read - is that clear? You have a left and a right, and if they overrun each other you can merge them.\nAnd the nice thing about that is we don’t know how long the fragments are, but if we’re able to merge them then we do know how long the fragments are so this gives us some information about the quality of the sequencing library. It gives us information about the size of the fragments. (Bowtie 2) reference genomes this is something I was doing on my laptop, but I’d like to do it on MCAW and I believe (Stefan) you, you already have a workflow for (Bowtie 2) right?"}
{"label":"99:Stefan","text":"Yeah. Yeah it generates the SAN files - it’s not doing a whole lot more, but..."}
{"label":"100:Bobby","text":"Okay - that’s okay. You know, you know (Bowtie 2) gives a nice output summary of standard error. So if it captures standard error for the purpose of this week that could be enough."}
{"label":"101:Stefan","text":"Okay."}
{"label":"102:Bobby","text":"But I can talk to you about that later."}
{"label":"103:Stefan","text":"Depends on, depends on if you want to parse that standard error and pull out some numbers and make the..."}
{"label":"104:Bobby","text":"Since there’s only 8 samples - I think eventually, yes but today we can just look at them."}
{"label":"105:Stefan","text":"Can I ask a question about the previous one, the (Panda Seek)?"}
{"label":"106:Bobby","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"107:Stefan","text":"Do you do that for every ingredient?"}
{"label":"108:Bobby","text":"No. So I’m just like kind of trying this..."}
{"label":"109:Stefan","text":"Yeah, okay."}
{"label":"110:Bobby","text":"...but whether or not I try to do it for all in the next, let’s say three days, I’m not sure, but maybe."}
{"label":"111:Stefan","text":"Well wouldn’t it tell us which ingredients have kind of short fragments and which ones have..."}
{"label":"112:Bobby","text":"Oh I can’t remember - you know what I think I did. I have a spreadsheet or I think I did do it for every sample but only for a million reads."}
{"label":"113:Stefan","text":"Okay."}
{"label":"114:Bobby","text":"Which is not - a million reads gives you a pretty decent idea of the general look of the data anyway, so I think its okay - actually it’s all samples."}
{"label":"115:Stefan","text":"Okay."}
{"label":"116:Bobby","text":"So I guess that brings us to Trinity, and I haven’t followed the Trinity very well up until now."}
{"label":"117:Niina","text":"Yeah and I haven’t either. I got the impression or maybe I assumed that (David) would run Trinity on the new sample as well. At least he has run some partial samples - some samples forms, but I don’t know the exact sizes of those."}
{"label":"118:Bobby","text":"What was the one sample that we had early access to - I think the most has been done on that one sample, so did anyone do Trinity on that sample?"}
{"label":"119:Stefan","text":"Yes I mean - so I was looking at it yesterday and I went through all the Trinity datasets we have and decided we do have more than one Trinity assembly per ingredient and some of them failed, and I don’t know why. It might be that it ran out of memory or we don’t know, but we do have at least one maybe two successful assembly for every ingredient."}
{"label":"120:Niina","text":"So those are smaller subsets right, not the whole?"}
{"label":"121:Stefan","text":"Yeah, like one-tenth."}
{"label":"122:Niina","text":"Yeah. I think (David) was saying this Trinity generates so many kind of intermediate small files that (unintelligible) we should clean up the workflow at some point. I mean clean up the output of Trinity."}
{"label":"123:Bobby","text":"Okay um, okay, so what I’m taking note of is just giving Trinity all the data from a single sample is not - it does not reliably produce an output."}
{"label":"124:Stefan","text":"I know (David) was working on it, and I think he was trying to run something on the Fat node because it needs a lot of memory…"}
{"label":"125:Bobby","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"126:Stefan","text":"yeah, we need to check with him, I’m not sure as much how far as he got with the output."}
{"label":"127:Bobby","text":"Okay. Um. So, so, the question is do we want to use time between now and Wednesday, which is the day before the meeting, to run some more Trinity and what exactly should we try to assemble?\nI mean, one idea is that we try to give Trinity smaller chunks of the data, but not necessarily a random chunk, but you know reads that we picked for a reason. So, for example, we can run - you know we can remove reads from the matrix so let’s just use chicken as the example- remove the chicken reads and then try to assemble what’s left. And that could be a relatively small number of reads compared to the original."}
{"label":"128:Stefan","text":"That’s still a lot of reads isn’t it? I mean if you look at the, if you look at the - I think typically only like 1% of something on the reads have (unintelligible) anything, right - unless you’re looking at corn - corn had more but...\n((Crosstalk))"}
{"label":"129:Bobby","text":"Um, that may or may not be true - I mean I’m seeing - so I did a quick test with a million reads mapping to cow for the sample that looks most like, you know, the sample that we’ve been calling meat and bone meal and I was getting upwards of 90% of reads mapping to cow. So you may be looking at about a 10% leftover."}
{"label":"130:Stefan","text":"Right."}
{"label":"131:Bobby","text":"And so what I could do is, I could supply - I think that Trinity is going to be particularly troublesome - in other words it’s going to be like a lot of work, so maybe we restrict Trinity to a single sample that we feel the best about. Um, and one idea is to go after whichever sample kind of gives us the strongest bacterial signal through the other views. So let’s say the sample that has the most bacteria using a BLAST analysis."}
{"label":"132:Stefan","text":"I would say that would be the meat and bone meal - that one is pretty diverse with all kinds of bacteria and viruses too."}
{"label":"133:Bobby","text":"Okay so, you know since I’ve been using (Bowtie) I can run (Bowtie) to map reads to the cow genome for example and then we can just say anything that doesn’t map is other and we’ll try to assemble that."}
{"label":"134:Stefan","text":"Yep."}
{"label":"135:Bobby","text":"And it may, you know, first of all there’s reasons to assemble with a subset of reads beyond just the memory requirements of the program. It’s because you just don’t necessarily want the assembler to have all of that extra, extra stuff to worry about. I mean if you, you know, if you have too many genomes in the mix that you don’t want to - you know, it could make the assembler make mistakes basically."}
{"label":"136:Niina","text":"Right. And Trinity is not really designed for this meta-transcript in the first place. I was thinking kind of from the opposite side if we take just the chicken reads and assemble them - for example and see how many errors we get compared to the reference we sort of know."}
{"label":"137:Bobby","text":"You know I like it - yes I like it a lot (Niina). It actually is a kind of an easier problem with an answer that we can verify."}
{"label":"138:Niina","text":"Exactly then we get some idea of how much is even recoverable from the RNA that we have."}
{"label":"139:Bobby","text":"I like that better."}
{"label":"140:Niina","text":"We can do both, but we have to split the read somehow and we can assemble both parts independently."}
{"label":"141:Bobby","text":"Right. So, so let’s do that experiment. Let’s do, you know, chicken or cow and we’ll do two assemblies one of the matrix and one of the non-matrix."}
{"label":"142:Niina","text":"Yeah sounds good."}
{"label":"143:Bobby","text":"So in MCAW I will generate a (Bowtie 2) output if all goes as well and then that would probably, at this point be manually parsed on the command line into two data sets, but um, I think that we just don’t have enough time to make it end-to-end point-and-click again before Wednesday."}
{"label":"144:Niina","text":"Sure."}
{"label":"145:Greg","text":"This may be an aside, but do you guys know about this program called (Rock Hopper)?"}
{"label":"146:Bobby","text":"No."}
{"label":"147:Greg","text":"I just saw it, it came out this year and they say it’s - the author’s say it’s much better than Trinity for (unintelligible) assembly, but it runs on much smaller software. I can send you the paper I found just – maybe, maybe not appropriate for this, but it’s - I can send this to you."}
{"label":"148:Bobby","text":"Well definitely send it. There’s no - I mean absolutely we wanted this, you know, we’re kind of agnostic as far as these tools. We’re just running tools that we deem, you know, we deem appropriate so a comparison to another tool is fine."}
{"label":"149:Greg","text":"I’ll send it, I’ll send you the link."}
{"label":"150:Bobby","text":"Does anyone, yeah…"}
{"label":"151:Stefan","text":"So for the (Bowtie 2) if you’re going to use that as a filter - I think it’s really - I think it’s pretty simple to add a few lines of code that’s just going to generate the output we want - the filtered output I mean. I think (Simone) sent some example on how to do it at some point."}
{"label":"152:Bobby","text":"Yeah, I mean it could be as simple as - it’s a single command line to filter the data set basically it’ll pass, you know, if you want one thing it’ll pass through just that one thing, and then if you want the other thing you just, you tell it to pass through the other thing. So like, you know, you might write with two filters, one is called chicken and one is called not chicken..."}
{"label":"153:Stefan","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"154:Bobby","text":"...and so you run one, and then you run the other, and then you have the output data set."}
{"label":"155:Jamie","text":"So this will speed up the assembly because you’re assembling less."}
{"label":"156:Bobby","text":"Yes. I mean I think it speeds because it’s less and also it’s supposed to assemble, like the chicken is supposed to assemble."}
{"label":"157:Jamie","text":"I know we don’t want to speculate at this point, but just hypothetically if there is a lot of say DNA contamination in the RNA, what is that going to do to our attempts to assemble the RNA that’s there?"}
{"label":"158:Bobby","text":"I don’t know, but maybe (Greg) can um – so (Greg) kind of brought this to our attention - brought it to my attention I honestly was not thinking about it until (Greg) mentioned so. (Greg) do you want to give a quick synopsis of why there might be DNA in the RNA samples."}
{"label":"159:Greg","text":"Well this is partly because of my ignorance, it was hard for me to understand why you were seeing so much RNA - matrix RNA in your analysis. And then I thought well maybe its DNA, is that possible? And I did a little bit of checking and the trizol extraction that they’re doing with this ponidimium isocyanate that’s supposed to, in the experiment - it’s supposed to clearly separate the RNA from the DNA which is what (Dylan) and (Bart) maintain.\nBut if you look at the procedures and I’ve actually done the procedure myself - if you screw it up, because you have to physically separate one layer from the other, it’s possible to contaminate with DNA. So if they were careful I guess there’s little, but then in the little bit of reading I did, this is an issue that people worry about all the time doing RNA sequencing\nAnd it almost seems to me that I would have said all the matrix RNA that you’re seeing is really DNA, that probably is wrong because you’re seeing way too much of it. In that paper I sent out the other day, they talked about animal samples and the problems they have with animal RNA contaminating their bacterial analysis, and that paper didn’t say anything about the grains and the corn and stuff."}
{"label":"160:Bobby","text":"(Greg) just to quick clarify, the paper which I have not read yet and has not been shared across everybody here which we should do right after this meeting. The paper talked about DNA contamination in RNA seek data is that right?"}
{"label":"161:Greg","text":"That was the one that how deep do you have to go, and there was a section in there about contamination. I think that’s the one I sent you, if not I’ll send you the one I just read the other day."}
{"label":"162:Jamie","text":"The idea is you do a face operation but it may not be perfect and..."}
{"label":"163:Greg","text":"Yeah you did that, you did that when when you did freshman chemistry you shake them up and if you don’t do it right."}
{"label":"164:Bobby","text":"I remember that chemistry experiment."}
{"label":"165:Greg","text":"But this is - I mean they showed it, this is exactly what you get. You get a red layer on the bottom with the (unintelligible) and the polidinium salt. There’s a white interface, looks like scum and then there’s this clear layer on the top..."}
{"label":"166:Jamie","text":"You want to stay away from that white interface."}
{"label":"167:Greg","text":"Yes, you want to stay away from that."}
{"label":"168:Jamie","text":"It’s hard to imagine they missed it if these, all cases."}
{"label":"169:Greg","text":"But that’s probably true, that’s why I say that’s - if you see so much of it I doubt that that’s the issue, but the point is there’s always a chance and these guys when they do this they always worry about, and then the analysis in the paper I sent they said - and their contention was well there’s only 1%, how much of a problem is it causing, he said it’s not a problem. So, the idea that this is a smoking gun I don’t think that’s right..."}
{"label":"170:Jamie","text":"All right, I just wanted to ask a question. I mean, (Bart) seemed - so (Dylan) seemed very confident they’re perfect and nothing was wrong. (Bart) seemed -  sends six papers and said yeah we could change what we’re doing but we think this is about the best.\n((Crosstalk))"}
{"label":"171:Greg","text":"Someone says, no - no it’s perfect - I never make mistakes..."}
{"label":"172:Jamie","text":"I know - I had the same reaction I just wasn’t going to argue, right."}
{"label":"173:Bobby","text":"The mystery – oh, go ahead anyone else."}
{"label":"174:Niina","text":"It’s a basic question, so if there is DNA and RNA in the mix how does the chemistry then work? Are you kind of sequencing both - some samples of both or..."}
{"label":"175:Greg","text":"I think what they do - this again, I’m not sure, but I think when they do the CDNA conversion of the RNA, you’re producing CDNA and then the DNA that may be contaminating goes along for the ride. But the amount of DNA that, what these papers say, was probably not that big, and I’ll, I’ll make sure you see the papers that you can look at them yourself because they talk..."}
{"label":"176:Niina","text":"That makes sense."}
{"label":"177:Greg","text":"...in the analysis of how much of a problem that’s going to be."}
{"label":"178:Bobby","text":"(Greg) if you could reply with a reply to all, you know, or otherwise I can send the paper to everybody on the call today."}
{"label":"179:Greg","text":"I can do that."}
{"label":"180:Bobby","text":"Ah, again the mystery is - just to re-say it one more time the mystery is, we do see a strong matrix signal in every sample and the, the guess before we undertook the experiment was that we would not see much matrix. And that leaves the question, is it that there is some contamination DNA or is it that even though, you know, even though there’s a lot of degradation of RNA there’s still enough RNA sitting around from the chicken that we see it.\nAnd to me - I don’t know - I think it’s a very difficult question, I don’t know today how to approach it computationally with certainty. It’s not so farfetched to me that there could be many small, approximately 200 base pair fragments of RNA from a chicken lying around, but to me - I mean 200 base pairs is not very big."}
{"label":"181:Greg","text":"And that’s, I think that’s the point right the issue with RNA it degrades really quickly. But…"}
{"label":"182:Bobby","text":"But that doesn’t mean it goes to zero."}
{"label":"183:Greg","text":"That’s right, you’re not going to fill up the matrix. I mean that was the concept right, you’re looking at bacteria and the bacteria are alive so they’re still expressing genes, they’re going to be producing more RNA. But in the dense stuff, the RNA is still there and it’s degraded, and then when you do this extraction you’re going to see the stuff you care about, bacterial RNA which you hope is largely intact and hasn’t been degraded badly, but then you’ve got all this degraded matrix RNA and so that’s why you see all kinds of matrix RNA. It’s still there it’s just degraded."}
{"label":"184:Jamie","text":"Yes, I believe that. So, um, what is a little more troubling is that when we do assembly we’re not seeing anything that isn’t, so far - we’re not seeing any that isn’t matrix.\n((Crosstalk))"}
{"label":"185:Jamie","text":"Let me finish my sentence which is, so first of all we only looked at 10% of the reads at most, but also when you were - so when (Stefan) took the output of the assembly, right? and compared it to the nucleotide database right?"}
{"label":"186:Bobby","text":"Right - okay."}
{"label":"187:Jamie","text":"And he only looked at contigs that were 1,000 or longer."}
{"label":"188:Stefan","text":"I’ve got some slides, you want me to share them (Bobby)?"}
{"label":"189:Jamie","text":"Yeah. I think you should look at..."}
{"label":"190:Bobby","text":"Yeah I can project..."}
{"label":"191:Stefan","text":"Oh actually I have a little bit more."}
{"label":"192:Bobby","text":"You want to – yeah, you project. I think you can steal the show so to speak. So you BLASTN Trinity output contigs versus what?"}
{"label":"193:Stefan","text":"NT. The NCBI NT database."}
{"label":"194:Bobby","text":"And, what was the size of the contigs?"}
{"label":"195:Stefan","text":"That’s what I just added to the - why can’t I - I’m sorry hold on."}
{"label":"196:Greg","text":"Can you make it, can you make it (unintelligible) - oh yes, there we go."}
{"label":"197:Stefan","text":"(Unintelligible) Oh sorry, it’s kind of, ah..."}
{"label":"198:Bobby","text":"Is it working? Does anybody see it?"}
{"label":"199:Stefan","text":"Can you see that?\n((Crosstalk))"}
{"label":"200:Stefan","text":"So let me tell you what I did…"}
{"label":"201:Greg","text":"Yes, we can."}
{"label":"202:Stefan","text":"I took - I went to (unintelligible) - I took the largest assembly we had for each ingredient. I was just looking at essentially the file sizes. All right, there might one-tenth of the data - it might have been less. I should probably check that. Anyway and then I took all the, all the assembled contigs that were larger than 1,000 nucleotides and I blasted them against the NCBI NT database. So if we look the bar showed up in the top right... This is worth the time isn’t it? ...but essentially the blue means it’s eukaryotes.\nMan (Jamie or Greg):Okay."}
{"label":"203:Stefan","text":"Yeah, so there’s essentially no bacteria."}
{"label":"204:Bobby","text":"Let’s - can we go, just take a step back. The first chart you’re showing is a 16S for all samples?"}
{"label":"205:Bobby","text":"No."}
{"label":"206:Stefan","text":"Sorry.\nMan (Jamie or Greg):No.  The left half of that…\n((Crosstalk))"}
{"label":"207:Bobby","text":"The first bar chart with the colors."}
{"label":"208:Stefan","text":"Yeah, that was the next thing I was going to talk about."}
{"label":"209:Bobby","text":"Oh sorry go ahead then."}
{"label":"210:Stefan","text":"This was looking at the super kingdom rank up there - right?"}
{"label":"211:Bobby","text":"So you um, you took the reads - well you took the contigs greater than like 1,000 and BLASTN (unintelligible)."}
{"label":"212:Stefan","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"213:Bobby","text":"And then the super kingdom which is like eukaryote or bacteria is all coming up almost entirely eukaryote."}
{"label":"214:Stefan","text":"That’s right."}
{"label":"215:Niina","text":"So isn’t that kind of expected, I mean the bacterial genes would be quite short, for it compared?"}
{"label":"216:Stefan","text":"Yeah. That’s a good point. I thought they were kind of like 1,000 or so - they might be smaller than that so."}
{"label":"217:Jamie","text":"It would be interesting to do this using the short contigs instead of the long ones."}
{"label":"218:Stefan","text":"Or all contigs if it’s possible. Anyways, yeah that might be the next thing we’ll try."}
{"label":"219:Greg","text":"The biggest genes for - eukaryote are on the order of 100 thousand - yes? (Unintelligible) is the biggest gene you can fill in? Gene size, gene size is just as you said (unintelligible) here we are 1,000 to 1,500 and eukaryotes are how much bigger?"}
{"label":"220:Stefan","text":"That’s a good question."}
{"label":"221:Greg","text":"I thought I saw the biggest ones only like 100 thousand - the biggest (unintelligible)."}
{"label":"222:Stefan","text":"I should say that none of the contigs re-assembles are larger than like five or six thousand, that’s the largest contig we found. Anyway so if you look at bar chart on the left, maybe you can read the colors. Essentially the brown things is fish. So I think the first bar on the left is essentially the fish meal, maybe. And the second from left I believe is the finished product because I was looking at the Diamond result that had one had a lot of fish in it too. Then we had two that’s (unintelligible) (memolias), I believe this is the bone and meat – ah, the meat and bone meal. This one that says others, that’s the (unintelligible) (protemeal), I assume, and then on the right we have two corn, ah corn meals. So even the assembled contigs seem to map back pretty clearly to what we think the ingredients are - I mean..."}
{"label":"223:Bobby","text":"Let me, let me just ask you, this color bar chart - this is the results from the contigs, is that right?"}
{"label":"224:Stefan","text":"Larger than 1,000 contigs – BLASTP against NT."}
{"label":"225:Bobby","text":"So you have a one-tenth assembly of everything."}
{"label":"226:Stefan","text":"Yes I took the largest assemblies which is like one-tenth - it might be even less than one-tenth for some of the data sets. I’m not sure if some of them failed for various reasons, but yes."}
{"label":"227:Bobby","text":"Okay - oh that’s good that’s more assembly than I thought was performed."}
{"label":"228:Stefan","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"229:Bobby","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"230:Stefan","text":"Um, and I should of - what I put down in this, all that right here is saying the number of reads that are large - I mean a number of contigs - I should say that are larger than 1,000 that’s the left here. So for this - this is going left to right you know, this is the left bars, the second from left, et cetera. So these say that, you know, there was 603 contigs larger than 1,000. Out of those 603 we had 220 hits against the NT database."}
{"label":"231:Jamie","text":"So that’s interesting, so there are 400 contigs that don’t hit anything."}
{"label":"232:Stefan","text":"That’s right, and we looked at that yesterday you and I, we..."}
{"label":"233:Man","text":"This is my other point (Bobby) which in my apparently badly written note, is we’re hoping to be discovering new things, so what do we do with the stuff that doesn’t match? Or is..."}
{"label":"234:Bobby","text":"I mean, I mean it’s like almost a philosophical question. I mean..."}
{"label":"235:Jamie","text":"I know."}
{"label":"236:Bobby","text":"...for the purpose of these types of analyses we’re comparing to known things. Right, but…"}
{"label":"237:Jamie","text":"Right we’re hoping to find some known things - right, but..."}
{"label":"238:Bobby","text":"Well like the known things are like, you know, they’re like your anchor that anchor you back to something that you can discuss otherwise it’s just a bunch of text."}
{"label":"239:Jamie","text":"Oh I agree. Don’t take, don’t take me - I’m not trying to make the converse statement - we want the known things definitely, we need to validate what we’re doing. Um…"}
{"label":"240:Bobby","text":"I mean, it’s a very valid question. I mean I feel like it’s part of - I feel like tracking, you know, putative genes let’s say that you assembled out of samples over time - I mean I feel like it’s a long-term kind of commitment and strategy question, like how will we record that this even occurred and keep, you know, keep track of it so we’ll see if we see it again."}
{"label":"241:Jamie","text":"Well, so there are different levels of it - right? If we see something and it’s never been seen before and it’s at most hypothetical - yes we can just remember that we saw it, but there’s a lot of data in NCBI that’s listed as hypothetical, founded in completely independent work - right? If we see that with high accuracy, it suggests there’s something to look at - right?"}
{"label":"242:Bobby","text":"Mm-hm."}
{"label":"243:Jamie","text":"Well now - we have to be careful not to over interpret it, but you know. Um, yeah."}
{"label":"244:Niina","text":"Just as an aside to inject - I checked in some papers, it says average prokaryotic coding sequence is 900 base pair and average eukaryotic is 1350."}
{"label":"245:Bobby","text":"Ah, so we biased it for eukaryotic. So we need to, we need to try the small ones. Yeah."}
{"label":"246:Jamie","text":"Yeah. Okay well that’s good - we’re learning - (Niina) that’s a great fact.\n(Niina):Yeah we’re learning."}
{"label":"247:Stefan","text":"All right - I mean I put some more trees - I don’t know what your - too much interest in looking at the hits and where they ended up exactly."}
{"label":"248:Greg","text":"This is all from Trinity data.  Right?"}
{"label":"249:Stefan","text":"This is all from Trinity data."}
{"label":"250:Greg","text":"When you did the 16S analysis, what did your biogenic tree look like?"}
{"label":"251:Jamie","text":"Well we saw matrix in that too."}
{"label":"252:Greg","text":"But did you see any bacteria in the 16S or..."}
{"label":"253:Stefan","text":"No, no, no, no, no…"}
{"label":"254:Jamie","text":"Oh no, the 16S. Sorry."}
{"label":"255:Greg","text":"The 16S is going to show bacteria."}
{"label":"256:Jamie","text":"Yes, what did the 16S show?"}
{"label":"257:Stefan","text":"I would rather look at, what the Diamond show – we ran on Diamond on all the…"}
{"label":"258:Jamie","text":"Show that, show that to (Greg)."}
{"label":"259:Greg","text":"The 16S, isn’t that the simplest thing?  You should be able to use chime or something and generate the, the bacterial tree there?"}
{"label":"260:Stefan","text":"Yes we do have those trees too."}
{"label":"261:Greg","text":"What kind of bacteria - then you could - the 16S tells you what kind of bacteria are there and then you go backwards and just look for the RNA from those (unintelligible) points."}
{"label":"262:Jamie","text":"Well, well so what is the... Let’s answer the first part, what does the 16S show?"}
{"label":"263:Stefan","text":"We have multiple 16S and I’m, I’m not...\nMan (Jamie or Greg):Can we just pick one?"}
{"label":"264:Stefan","text":"(Bobby) did you look at another - I mean..."}
{"label":"265:Bobby","text":"Well you um, you showed, you showed me a (unintelligible) last week on Friday and it was a 16S results that you computed and you made the bar charts there - you made like the colored stack bars."}
{"label":"266:Stefan","text":"The RDP didn’t come up very - I mean it was kind of noisy - they all kind of looked the same - I didn’t like that."}
{"label":"267:Greg","text":"What RDP?"}
{"label":"268:Stefan","text":"RDP is the 16S classifier."}
{"label":"269:Greg","text":"Okay."}
{"label":"270:Stefan","text":"Um… sorry I need to, if I want to show that, I need to share something…"}
{"label":"271:Greg","text":"The 16S isn’t working right."}
{"label":"272:Bobby","text":"Um, (Greg) the 16S would depend on, you know it’s sort of a number game also. We, you know we’re not – you know, how much 16S gene do we see and of those what fraction of the reads fall into a region of the gene that’s informative versus uninformative. So it may be that we’re just in the preliminary results that this discussion showed last week there, there just weren’t high enough numbers to even believe it.\nThat doesn’t mean that’s the answer, the answer could be that we filter a little less stringently let’s say like SortMeRNA is trying to pick the reads that are 16S while maybe we turn a knob and we let it be a little more promiscuous for example and that’ll give us potentially more reads. But that was a problem,  we may not just see very much of the 16S by happenstance."}
{"label":"273:Jamie","text":"Okay so..."}
{"label":"274:Greg","text":"But you should see a lot. You should see an enormous amount it should be much higher than everything else right?  Because this is the ribosome RNA?"}
{"label":"275:Jamie","text":"It’s not going to be, it’s not going to be matrix – it’s not going to be higher matrix, it’s just going to be.  So this is the question, we’re not sure how much bacteria we’re seeing period…"}
{"label":"276:Greg","text":"But can you…"}
{"label":"277:Jamie","text":"…and 16S is a subset of it."}
{"label":"278:Bobby","text":"That’s right."}
{"label":"279:Greg","text":"So, that’s right…\n(Bobby):It should be a high fraction of the bacterial RNA but the bacterial RNA would be low fraction of the total samples."}
{"label":"280:Jamie","text":"We don’t know yet."}
{"label":"281:Greg","text":"But can’t you, can’t you filter, can you filter against 18S because all the eukaryotes should be showing 18S right?"}
{"label":"282:Bobby","text":"Yes - yes we could do that too."}
{"label":"283:Jamie","text":"Okay so what - can we look..."}
{"label":"284:Bobby","text":"We’re getting off track so what was the..."}
{"label":"285:Stefan","text":"Yean - I mean I don’t..."}
{"label":"286:Bobby","text":"…let’s back to (Stefan)."}
{"label":"287:Stefan","text":"Well sure, but this is looking at RDP."}
{"label":"288:Bobby","text":"I see periodicity."}
{"label":"289:Jamie","text":"You see similarity between some samples."}
{"label":"290:Stefan","text":"I see, they all seem very… yeah, chloroplasts…"}
{"label":"291:Bobby","text":"Although."}
{"label":"292:Stefan","text":"I mean I don’t know what to look at - I mean we could look at the phylums if that’s any better."}
{"label":"293:Bobby","text":"The color schemes may actually - they’re reused, so you have to be careful of the colors."}
{"label":"294:Stefan","text":"Yeah, but the all seem to be somewhat consistent."}
{"label":"295:Jamie","text":"So which phylum is chlamydia in?  I’ll, I’ll look at this one…"}
{"label":"296:Bobby","text":"Right."}
{"label":"297:Jamie","text":"I’m just wondering if it’s consistent - right?"}
{"label":"298:Stefan","text":"I don’t like RDP output, its just…  I don’t know what it means."}
{"label":"299:Jamie","text":"Chlamydia… what was it chlamydia what? Um…"}
{"label":"300:Stefan","text":"Psittacci, psittacci, psittacci…"}
{"label":"301:Jamie","text":"Psittacci. I want to see what phylum it is.\nAnd we think we saw a lot of it, right?\nIt’s been reclassified. Here we go it’s in the phylum - it’s in kingdom bacteria and the phylum is chlamydiae."}
{"label":"302:Stefan","text":"Let’s go look at what the chicken - what material is on chicken, if I can find that. Um…"}
{"label":"303:Man","text":"(Unintelligible)."}
{"label":"304:Stefan","text":"I have to navigate the application..."}
{"label":"305:Jamie","text":"Seems to be it’s own - its own thing."}
{"label":"306:Stefan","text":"Now where’s the chicken meal - the chicken is ah, poultry...  (unintelligible, and typing in background)\nRDP, here’s chicken, I believe.\nThis is, RDP this is what RDP.  This is what RDP thinks is in the chicken or the poultry meal."}
{"label":"307:Man","text":"(Sigh)"}
{"label":"308:Bobby","text":"Go up - what’s the biggest high-level thing?"}
{"label":"309:Jamie","text":"(unintelligible) bacteria…"}
{"label":"310:Stefan","text":"The highest, is bacteria..."}
{"label":"311:Jamie","text":"I wonder that, yeah."}
{"label":"312:Stefan","text":"Um. (Unintelligible) bacteria."}
{"label":"313:Jamie","text":"Protobacteria. It doesn’t even seem to have chlamydia on the list."}
{"label":"314:Stefan","text":"That’s the thing though, yeah."}
{"label":"315:Jamie","text":"There’s an issue with our references right? If our references aren’t consistent..."}
{"label":"316:Stefan","text":"Protobacteria…"}
{"label":"317:Bobby","text":"I think RDP’s data set of um, 16S example sequence is small."}
{"label":"318:Jamie","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"319:Stefan","text":"Um."}
{"label":"320:Bobby","text":"And so, so you know, things could be missing that’s, that’s…"}
{"label":"321:Jamie","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"322:Bobby","text":"… definitely true."}
{"label":"323:Stefan","text":"This is why I like the Diamond so much better - I mean, Diamond is..."}
{"label":"324:Jamie","text":"Well and the other thing that’s nice about the idea of matching to protein is if we think we have RNA we should match to protein and if we don’t then we - there’s an indication of a problem."}
{"label":"325:Bobby","text":"Well the way that I’m going to try to resolve this um, is the big RNA - the big 16S database is green genes and then we have it it’s just another big FASTA file full of sequences."}
{"label":"326:Jamie","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"327:Bobby","text":"And to use it efficiently, ah… the nice way to use it would be to use it as the um, underlying data set for classifier, like RDP classfier. Now RDP classifier comes prepackaged with RDP’s data set but you can also use RDP classifier with the green gene’s data set."}
{"label":"328:Jamie","text":"Right."}
{"label":"329:Bobby","text":"It simply is ah, - I actually went through this yesterday. I basically spent all day trying to get it to work and couldn’t, so um, I could spend another day on that. What that would give us is a data set that, that the industry feels like is ah, as complete as it can be today."}
{"label":"330:Jamie","text":"Is it color or is it bias to some thing - I mean that’s..."}
{"label":"331:Bobby","text":"Well it’s definitely biased. I mean it’s biased towards what’s been sequenced."}
{"label":"332:Jamie","text":"Yeah, (chuckle) I know, but I mean in terms of like duplicates and stupid things like that."}
{"label":"333:Bobby","text":"Um. I mean, it, it could be."}
{"label":"334:Jamie","text":"Well, there’s…"}
{"label":"335:Stefan","text":"This is what Diamond says is in the chain of poultry meal, you know, 60% Chlamydia bacteria and (unintelligible) what it is, 40% chicken."}
{"label":"336:Bobby","text":"The reason I was bringing up green genes is, if we can’t confirm the Diamond result with 16S, then that, that makes - again if you can’t confirm it using a different method - complimentary method, then, then it draws into question whether this is real.\nYou know, so, I mean something that..."}
{"label":"337:Jamie","text":"Well, we want to see it in two methods - I agree."}
{"label":"338:Greg","text":"This, this…"}
{"label":"339:Bobby","text":"…something that is so - I mean that signal is off the charts…"}
{"label":"340:Jamie","text":"It is."}
{"label":"341:Bobby","text":"It’s the dominate signal."}
{"label":"342:Jamie","text":"That’s right."}
{"label":"343:Bobby","text":"So if… if the actual 16S status says that there’s almost no bacteria then that’s, that’s you know, that’s a problem."}
{"label":"344:Jamie","text":"Well we have to make sure that chlamydia is in the reference."}
{"label":"345:Niina","text":"Right in the 16S data."}
{"label":"346:Jamie","text":"If it’s not in the 16S reference then we won’t see it."}
{"label":"347:Bobby","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"348:Jamie","text":"But if it is in it, then we should get - then you’re right, we should get a huge hit."}
{"label":"349:Bobby","text":"Right. So, I mean, I think - I mean the way to present these results I think initially is, you know, these are preliminary results. You know this, this is what we did and this is what we got and we’re not saying that chlamydia is necessarily in your chicken we’re saying that this, you know, this needs to be confirmed and we’re working, you know, on that over time…"}
{"label":"350:Jamie","text":"Yeah, yeah, for next week…"}
{"label":"351:Bobby","text":"…I still think it’s, it’s an intriguing story."}
{"label":"352:Jamie","text":"For next week what we should aim to do is to show the most complete and exciting set of facts of just what the data analysis showed and see if there’s overlap with what Davis is going to show. In other words if we just agree on facts that’s useful, because the big goal here is to see, is Bart doing the right thing in the laboratory before he spends - he now has the next set of samples and before he spends a lot of money on them - we want to, we need to understand do we have RNA - is it pure enough, you know, can we get out of this data..."}
{"label":"353:Greg","text":"Well what do you think their, their approach is going to be?"}
{"label":"354:Jamie","text":"It can’t be that, do you mean, informatically?"}
{"label":"355:Greg","text":"No. They did - this was their experiment - this was how they wanted to do it..."}
{"label":"356:Jamie","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"357:Greg","text":"...over your objections early on versus 16S..."}
{"label":"358:Jamie","text":"No - no – no – no –no ...  I did not…\n((Crosstalk))"}
{"label":"359:Jamie","text":"I’m not against what they’re doing."}
{"label":"360:Greg","text":"But you want to start simple."}
{"label":"361:Jamie","text":"We wanted to – I I think – I, I believe my position was we should have both, but ah..."}
{"label":"362:Greg","text":"But anyway, the problem just in terms of human nature, this is their approach they picked it and I think they’re going..."}
{"label":"363:Jamie","text":"It doesn’t matter. The question is what is the, how does the data look? Do we - when we look at this data and when, when (Davis) looks at the data the first question is do we see the same thing."}
{"label":"364:Greg","text":"Couldn’t you also make the point of..."}
{"label":"365:Jamie","text":"Before we even interpret it, did we see the same thing, did we..."}
{"label":"366:Greg","text":"Of asking questions and things…"}
{"label":"367:Jamie","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"368:Greg","text":"…okay, this is - we’ve looked at and then starting at the first one - I do not know enough about this - the quality scores – what, you did the quality scores, how was quality."}
{"label":"369:Jamie","text":"Right."}
{"label":"370:Greg","text":"How you - I mean, the point of this is to see if you want to continue with and don’t you want to sort of..."}
{"label":"371:Jamie","text":"Well, so…  In…"}
{"label":"372:Greg","text":"…make this a semi-adversarial relationship and say, ask them this, ask them this, ask them this?"}
{"label":"373:Jamie","text":"…well, so, in the sense of (Bart) I think it’s - it is, you know, we’re not doing isolates and it may be that the metagenomics in general, the samples are dirtier and we’re going to have to deal with some small fragments and things like that and degraded stuff, but the question is is there signal, you know, just from an experimental (unintelligible)..."}
{"label":"374:Greg","text":"Well, let me just ask you this, based on what you guys have seen so far, is this looking, easy to deal with - easy to interpret - it looks or, you don’t know enough."}
{"label":"375:Jamie","text":"I think there are things in this data that is hughly exciting and there’s things that are discouraging and we have to do more work. Before. I don’t think we know yet whether we’re, whether we’re going to get the signal we need out of this data."}
{"label":"376:Greg","text":"So the, the bottom line is, the question to you is, do you want to start - at this meeting, do you want to ask these guys hard questions or what you think are hard questions?"}
{"label":"377:Jamie","text":"I don’t want to be adversarial - I want us to show, this is what we found about the current data. And then I want to hear what they found. And then if we agree on that, then we say okay what does it mean and what do we need to do? I mean let’s take it one step at a time.\nSo, what would convince me - right - I mean, first of all we ought to sample all the data, not 10% of it - right? (Bobby) is right and (Stefan)’s right we need to be able to see, you know, if we think there’s something like chlamydia we want to see evidence for that using (food) techniques not just (unintelligible).\nWe’re still learning from the informatics side, so we, we want to agree on where we’re at and then figure out what the right next steps are, and then we can get into a philosophical discussion. Okay, if this fails and that fails, what do we change?"}
{"label":"378:Greg","text":"That’s not philosophy, I was. What if.  So, the approach of, we’re looking at this and we see an enormous amounts of RNA. You see an enormous amount of RNA? Yeah.  Or, no they don’t because they did it differently. Don’t you… You don’t want to, it doesn’t make sense to start off…"}
{"label":"379:Jamie","text":"Well we don’t know which… we don’t know…"}
{"label":"380:Greg","text":"… it doesn’t make sense to start off with the questions that you’ve ah, come up with.  The 16S data…"}
{"label":"381:Bobby","text":"(Greg) I, I think ah, I think. I mean to (Jamie’s) point, you know, let’s just present ah, you know we, the way I structured this today was here’s what we did. We BLASTed this versus this and this was the output, and you know, you, you could just look at that without interpreting it too much you can just look at that and see if that agrees with something substantially similar that they did which I’m sure they would have done something along those lines. Perhaps."}
{"label":"382:Man","text":"Right."}
{"label":"383:Bobby","text":"It’s way too early to get into - you know, I mean to be honest we are too naïve to really make a strong statement about, about the lab side, which is why you’re in the meeting today is you can help us do that, but you know let’s just, let’s just take it easy and..."}
{"label":"384:Greg","text":"(unintelligible) to ask the question though."}
{"label":"385:Jamie","text":"It’s what we want to get to, right? We, and the problem is, we have to do enough of the right informatics to be, to usefully advise the lab side. I mean at this point we’re conjecturing a little bit, right.\nSo, if we, you know, we assembled – sorry, we compared these contigs to a database and we picked only the long ones. Well we should have picked the short ones, right. So we’re really learning, you know. We do a, a 16S analysis against a reference and the reference is missing all the organisms we think we found from the protein. So we haven’t done the right things yet, right. We have to, we have to figure out what those are."}
{"label":"386:Stefan","text":"(Bobby). Can I ask…"}
{"label":"387:Bobby","text":"Yes."}
{"label":"388:Stefan","text":"So if you want to verify that we can see chlamydia using a different technique. If we were to see that running, BLASTing against NT with just, you know, million reads, would that be..."}
{"label":"389:Bobby","text":"It’s helpful."}
{"label":"390:Stefan","text":"...good enough for you?"}
{"label":"391:Bobby","text":"It’s helpful. Yeah, that’s I mean – go, I mean if that’s not already - that was already done though, right?"}
{"label":"392:Stefan","text":"I don’t think we’ve done that actually, so that’s something we should do."}
{"label":"393:Bobby","text":"That goes back to um, finishing. Right, remember where we said some samples were done and some weren’t done. BLASTing a million reads from each is a great first thing to do."}
{"label":"394:Stefan","text":"But would it be bad though, to just take the first million is that, I mean kind of - yeah."}
{"label":"395:Bobby","text":"I’m okay with it."}
{"label":"396:Stefan","text":"I can, I mean..."}
{"label":"397:Niina","text":"For these BLAST, did you use kind of the standard scores or did you have to lower the thresholds to get any?"}
{"label":"398:Bobby","text":"You know, and that’s a great question (Niina). Do you remember (Stefan) if you do any filtering on scores?"}
{"label":"399:Stefan","text":"Ah, yeah…"}
{"label":"400:Bobby","text":"That’s what our conversation was yesterday about the chlamydia example."}
{"label":"401:Stefan","text":"Ah…"}
{"label":"402:Niina","text":"Just to make sure that they are good quality hits if we do get hits."}
{"label":"403:Stefan","text":"This one was..."}
{"label":"404:Bobby","text":"Right, I agree. I mean the most conservative statement is to pick high scores and to disregard all others."}
{"label":"405:Jamie","text":"The question is what is the minimum?"}
{"label":"406:Stefan","text":"So I ran this one on the poultry meal, 45 with threshold and with 70. I sent some numbers yesterday to (Bobby) about - to everybody and we still see lots of chlamydia, same results."}
{"label":"407:Jamie","text":"I, I…"}
{"label":"408:Bobby","text":"Is that true?"}
{"label":"409:Jamie","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"410:Stefan","text":"Oh yeah."}
{"label":"411:Jamie","text":"We are seeing the hypothetical thing that’s been seen before. I have no doubt about that. Whether that hypothetical thing is actually coming from chlamydia or something else, I mean these guys do horizontal gene transfer.\nWe don’t know which protein it is…"}
{"label":"412:Man","text":"Yeah"}
{"label":"413:Jamie","text":"…right? It’s just, it happens to match a protein that was seen in somebody’s chlamydia isolate. That doesn’t mean it isn’t in other things.\nSo, from what I’ve…"}
{"label":"414:Bobby","text":"Right, right okay."}
{"label":"415:Jamie","text":"…read about this chlamydia, it’s endemic in these birds and so are a lot of other bacterias."}
{"label":"416:Greg","text":"This is, wow…"}
{"label":"417:Jamie","text":"It happens to be a dominant protein in our sample. But maybe you could find that pro…, you know, I don’t know, I mean there is biology here we don’t know yet, right? If a protein that’s been seen in the past in chlamydia."}
{"label":"418:Stefan","text":"Maybe it’s really alive, you know"}
{"label":"419:Greg","text":"What’s the, what’s the name of the protein?"}
{"label":"420:Jamie","text":"It’s, it’s hypothetical. Nobody’s done that work yet, as far we know."}
{"label":"421:Man","text":"(chuckling)"}
{"label":"422:Bobby","text":"Well so, let me maybe just clarify the definition of a hypothetical protein is often simply that according to some method, usually computational, it looks like a protein. Um, that’s basically all it means.\nSo, in general these are predictions of a computational algorithm run over a sequence. And whether or not it is a protein or not is…"}
{"label":"423:Stefan","text":"(unintelligible)"}
{"label":"424:Bobby","text":"…really unknown."}
{"label":"425:Man","text":"Oh."}
{"label":"426:Bobby","text":"Now, that we see a lot of something being transcribed that is evidence in favor of it being a protein."}
{"label":"427:Jamie","text":"Yeah. Supporting, but we still don’t know what it is. And you do get the transfer, right."}
{"label":"428:Niina","text":"Right."}
{"label":"429:Jamie","text":"The fact that it’s a protein that has been seen in an organism that’s been seen in poultry is intriguing, but that could be, it could be for all we know on a plasma that, or something right."}
{"label":"430:Greg","text":"Or it could be a protein that chickens have."}
{"label":"431:Niina","text":"Exactly yes."}
{"label":"432:Greg","text":"I mean I’m just trying to - that’s why I asked, is this like insulin, everybody’s got this."}
{"label":"433:Jamie","text":"Well except the data, the reference data is from an isolate presumably, right. So not - it wasn’t a chicken isolate..."}
{"label":"434:Greg","text":"Well anyway, (unintelligible) if you knew what protein it was you could…"}
{"label":"435:Jamie","text":"Yeah. Yeah, that would be great, right."}
{"label":"436:Stefan","text":"That’s not the (unintelligible) database…\n(Niina):Sorry. Coming back to the discussion before of what we’re showing next week, I agree with (Bobby) that we can show - we used some standard tools and this is what we got, and maybe their results don’t agree and then we have to discuss how to take things further. Maybe we have to develop some new methods to deal with this."}
{"label":"437:Bobby","text":"Yeah, I mean, the final - I mean, I feel like we need to be very objective. Way to, it’s way to too early to, to over interpret. So we’ll be as objective as we can be. And some of the data will speak for itself. So, you know, if we say, you know, using two different methods this is what fraction of the sample appears to be chicken. Ah, you know, and if that number is very high, you know, (Mars) can look at that and decide, you know, hey maybe we should do something different, or that’s acceptable. That’s an acceptable amount of data to, to be of low value. So..."}
{"label":"438:Jamie","text":"(Bobby)."}
{"label":"439:Bobby","text":"... I feel like, as objective as possible is the way to go."}
{"label":"440:Jamie","text":"Yeah, I agree. And what’s important now is that we agree on certain facts because we want to get to the answer of the question are see seeing RNA, are we seeing microorganisms, or do we need to change the lab prep, that’s where we are going. (Bobby) can you check that reference to see if it contains chlamydia psittaci?"}
{"label":"441:Bobby","text":"Yes, since that seems to be an interesting story, I can spend some of the next day or two trying to dig a little deeper, it may - it may involve a lot of backup work between me and (Stefan) to kind of dig a little deeper. But, is the question, can we build out a story for this chlamydia..."}
{"label":"442:Jamie","text":"Well, well..."}
{"label":"443:Bobby","text":"...(unintelligible) is that the question?"}
{"label":"444:Jamie","text":"...I’m just curious about it. So the reference that you said that comes - I forget the name of the reference, for 16S. Um…"}
{"label":"445:Bobby","text":"The, oh the different, yeah the different reference sources. There’s green genes..."}
{"label":"446:Jamie","text":"The small one."}
{"label":"447:Bobby","text":"...there’s RDP."}
{"label":"448:Jamie","text":"Right, so it was, RDP’s the small one, right?"}
{"label":"449:Bobby","text":"Right."}
{"label":"450:Jamie","text":"Right, so the question is does RDP have the 16, have a 16S from chlamydia psittaci?"}
{"label":"451:Bobby","text":"It’s a good question. So, exactly."}
{"label":"452:Jamie","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"453:Bobby","text":"...to double check."}
{"label":"454:Simone","text":"There is a DNA."}
{"label":"455:Jamie","text":"What?"}
{"label":"456:Simone","text":"…a ribosomal DNA that’s (unintelligible), I posted its on the chart. Um, so there should be – it, it is known, essentially. I’m not sure if it is in that database though."}
{"label":"457:Jamie","text":"Yeah, that was my question. So…"}
{"label":"458:Simone","text":"(unintelligible)"}
{"label":"459:Jamie","text":"…yeah, if it’s not in that database could we just add that one and rerun it and see if we get some huge signal or not? Is that a valid thing?"}
{"label":"460:Bobby","text":"Um, yeah, I think I’d prefer to be a little more comprehensive and use..."}
{"label":"461:Jamie","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"462:Bobby","text":"...we’ll see if we can use the um, green genes database instead and which it’s supposed to be the most comprehensive. Of course we should also check that one to see if chlamydia is represented."}
{"label":"463:Jamie","text":"Check that it’s there yeah, right. Okay."}
{"label":"464:Bobby","text":"Okay, I mean I feel like this has been a pretty, a pretty decent meeting. We’ve, we’ve already gone an hour and I’ve been totally intrigued by every aspect of it."}
{"label":"465:Jamie","text":"Well (Bobby) do we try to define like just two or three big goals before the 14th?"}
{"label":"466:Bobby","text":"Absolutely. I mean, I mean, basically analysis should be completed at least by the day before. So, we’re really looking at like um, Tuesday to be done. And ah, with I’m sure maybe someone will be burning the midnight oil to see if one more thing can be done."}
{"label":"467:Stefan","text":"(Bobby) should we have this call maybe Tuesday or Wednesday, maybe to go..."}
{"label":"468:Bobby","text":"Well, I think Tuesday is too late. How about Tuesday morning, yeah."}
{"label":"469:Stefan","text":"Yeah, I’m thinking, probably useful."}
{"label":"470:Bobby","text":"So, I gave a deck out. Um, if you want to add something to the deck, then at least it’ll be formatted, you know, pretty and we can just merge on Tuesday. But what I was imaging is that there would be - this would be sort of one template – of, we did this.\nThen there is sort of a couple interesting stories that we could go into like the chlamydia one. And um, and also some summary tables with - which I feel like is the most important – and ah, you know, and (Niina’s) suggestion, (Stefan) actually has a spreadsheet, and I feel like filling out that spreadsheet is sort of a major task for us between now and Tuesday, which is something like, you know, we did BLAST and we got this many reads got a hit and this fraction of reads got a hit.\nSo just, um, so like for everything on page one of ‘we did this’, we’ll have some numbers. And, that you can glance at that and have a quick impression of sort of how the reads fall into different buckets, bacterial or not bacterial."}
{"label":"471:Stefan","text":"Mm-hm."}
{"label":"472:Bobby","text":"So maybe, what we’ll do is we’ll circulate that spreadsheet every other day as well. So um, if someone is going to make an entry into it they can."}
{"label":"473:Stefan","text":"So I think you’re saying so we have something for only Diamond right now. You’re saying we should have the same for, you know, 16S workflow and the same whatever we can do with (Trinity). Um."}
{"label":"474:Bobby","text":"Yeah I, I think, I mean yeah. I mean, to be short I mean we can say again, a one page summary table that gives the kind of fractions of read reducing a, a hit or whatever the benchmark is."}
{"label":"475:Stefan","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"476:Bobby","text":"Does anyone - now (Jamie), do you want to set some bigger to dos?"}
{"label":"477:Jamie","text":"Um… I think you guys are in the best place to decide what’s achievable because I don’t know how long these things are going to take to run."}
{"label":"478:Stefan","text":"The Trinity (unintelliglbe)."}
{"label":"479:Jamie","text":"The full assembly, we may not have that but. Well, I mean I think I agree with what I’ve heard right. I mean trying to pick one or two of the interesting things and seeing if this shows up for the second technique, that’s really good. Um, and then looking at the shorter contigs to see if there’s any bacteria, seems like an important question."}
{"label":"480:Bobby","text":"Okay, so um, I said that I would do - I would filter a data set into buckets of matrix and not matrix. So I can do that today. I might even already have it done. And then um, and then what we’ll do is, who would I give that to run assembly on both?"}
{"label":"481:Stefan","text":"Um, give it to me…"}
{"label":"482:Bobby","text":"Stefan."}
{"label":"483:Stefan","text":"…I can."}
{"label":"484:Jamie","text":"So when we, one question. So, when we say matrix and not matrix, by matrix we don’t mean eukaryote, right. We mean chicken or beef because there could be parasites that are eukaryotes that we would want to know about."}
{"label":"485:Bobby","text":"Sure, yeah."}
{"label":"486:Jamie","text":"So, the filter is actually fairly specific. I mean, if we just remove anything that looks like chicken, fish, beef or corn, everything else is interesting."}
{"label":"487:Stefan","text":"So let me ask something else that came out of the Diamond that - sorry, um. Every ingredient has traces and maybe even more than traces of every other ingredient.\nSo if you look at the spreadsheet I sent out, you know, the meat and bone meal has corn in it, has fish in it, you know. I found that - so either is some contamination going on or..."}
{"label":"488:Jamie","text":"I kind of believe that. So if you think about it at the factory, right, and the train cars come in and they’ve got a scoop and, you know, how well do they clean that scoop between sampling, and."}
{"label":"489:Stefan","text":"Yeah, so when you say removing the matrix, I think it means removing all matrixes."}
{"label":"490:Jamie","text":"But, but. Well, all of the six. So, I’m saying don’t try and remove anything that looks like eukaryote but definitely try and remove anything that looks like chicken or beef or corn or whatever the six ingredients were, right?"}
{"label":"491:Greg","text":"Can a human be ah, in this Diamond thing?"}
{"label":"492:Jamie","text":"Yeah, ah this some…"}
{"label":"493:Stefan","text":"…tend to see some human too."}
{"label":"494:Jamie","text":"…a little bit maybe."}
{"label":"495:Greg","text":"You mean, a little bit compared to…"}
{"label":"496:Niina","text":"And mouse and rat and the usual suspects in the lab.\nMan (Jamie or Stefan):Yeah."}
{"label":"497:Greg","text":"Compared to bacteria, what’s the proportion? Of mouse, rat, human to bacteria?"}
{"label":"498:Bobby","text":"It’s very hard to say because there’s so much conserved DNA among mammals."}
{"label":"499:Jamie","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"500:Bobby","text":"Whether or not it’s really rat or if it’s just human, it’s very hard to say."}
{"label":"501:Greg","text":"But are you trying to get a feel for how much, how much bacteria you see?"}
{"label":"502:Bobby","text":"Yeah absolutely. Absolutely."}
{"label":"503:Jamie","text":"But one of the techniques, and I think it was from the nucleotide database not from the proteins, showed a lot of nematodes in the beef, right? And the other one showed a lot of Texas fever bacteria in the beef.\nSo, and so we’re, we’re learning - I think we’re getting different things from different techniques. So this is where somehow doing it - I like what..."}
{"label":"504:Stefan","text":"It is what you pulled out, there is a fraction of bacteria in the - in seven of the eight samples. One we haven’t been able to run Diamond on yet, I’m sure why."}
{"label":"505:Bobby","text":"So (Stefan) to (Jamie’s) point there."}
{"label":"506:Stefan","text":"Yeah."}
{"label":"507:Bobby","text":"I feel like I don’t know what the BLAST cutoffs are that you’re using. And so I just feel like, it would put me at ease if you were to pick some very high cutoffs and redo all of these like summary plots."}
{"label":"508:Stefan","text":"Sure. That would..."}
{"label":"509:Bobby","text":"Like, like we talked about yesterday. So you basically said that if you go below ah, a score of 70 you’re not seeing almost anything. So maybe, maybe 70 is as good as anything but um, you know like, because I just, I just know that the LCA spits out lots of garbage when you use very low quality hits."}
{"label":"510:Niina","text":"Yeah that’s a good point, yeah we should do that."}
{"label":"511:Bobby","text":"So if we just say we’re only going to, for the purpose of week one we’re only going to use high cutoffs, um I think that will simplify the picture and I just wonder how much of the nematode will disappear and everything else will disappear when you just go with really strong hits."}
{"label":"512:Stefan","text":"Yeah. Sure."}
{"label":"513:Bobby","text":"So a technical question is, is this something I could do? Can I go into um, a BLAST output and re-tally it with a cutoff?"}
{"label":"514:Stefan","text":"Yep um, I would go into any data set right now that has the BLAST tally output, from that you can see the histogram of where the bits score end up. From that you can figure out which threshold you want to use.\nI did it for the chicken one and um, but yeah."}
{"label":"515:Bobby","text":"But then can I resubmit a new job, a new tally job?"}
{"label":"516:Stefan","text":"Yeah, you just clone that. You clone it and it brings it back to the launching of the workflow and you just change the value of that threshold."}
{"label":"517:Bobby","text":"I’m embarrassed to say I don’t know how to clone it, is there a button?"}
{"label":"518:Stefan","text":"Yeah there’s a button, there’s two buttons, ah..."}
{"label":"519:Niina","text":"It looks like a guy running, right?"}
{"label":"520:Stefan","text":"Yeah you pick, you pick the data set in, say the analytics tab. You click the little button on the top left of the toolbar it looks like the site circle."}
{"label":"521:Jamie","text":"Show dataset creator action."}
{"label":"522:Stefan","text":"It takes you to the action, you select that action, and you click the little running guy."}
{"label":"523:Bobby","text":"Show dataset creator action. So, okay I clicked the circle, then it takes me to task, then I see the running, a running man."}
{"label":"524:Jamie","text":"Pick, select the dataset first."}
{"label":"525:Stefan","text":"Select the dataset."}
{"label":"526:Jamie","text":"Then click the running man."}
{"label":"527:Stefan","text":"…the running man."}
{"label":"528:Bobby","text":"Then there’s a running man. Does it actually, at that moment I click the running man actually make a new data set?"}
{"label":"529:Stefan","text":"It clones it."}
{"label":"530:Jamie","text":"It clones the task, and now change the threshold."}
{"label":"531:Stefan","text":"Now just change the threshold, yeah."}
{"label":"532:Bobby","text":"You know, I’ve been hitting that running man not knowing, (chuckle) not knowing at all what it was doing."}
{"label":"533:Stefan","text":"That’s how you do it."}
{"label":"534:Bobby","text":"I’m glad I asked."}
{"label":"535:Greg","text":"The sample says, that .1% bacteria."}
{"label":"536:Jamie","text":"The corn, so he admits corn’s not working very well. Corn is showing only corn matrix."}
{"label":"537:Bobby","text":"I want to be respectful of people’s time, so could we say that this is the end of the official meeting and anybody hang out?"}
{"label":"538:Man","text":"Yeah, sure."}
{"label":"539:Jamie","text":"This is great (Bobby), thank you, I learned a lot."}
{"label":"540:Bobby","text":"Yeah, so did I."}
{"label":"541:Jamie","text":"Okay."}
{"label":"542:Cheryl","text":"So (Bobby), if this is the end of the official..."}
{"label":"543:Bobby","text":"I’m going to stop recording."}
{"label":"544:Cheryl","text":"...thank you, star 2."}
{"label":"545:Bobby","text":"All right."}
