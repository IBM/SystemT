<li>They create a partnership between LOB&#39;s and IT, enabling IT to do what it does best -- unlock information, and the business users to do what they do best -- build what is exactly needed by them.&#0160; In addition, it can help justify the ROI of projects so as to enable IT to focus on building those apps that have a proven ROI.</li>
<li>And guaranteeing security, access control and the rights -- balancing them with flexibility (<a href=""http://jhingran.typepad.com/anant_jhingrans_musings/2007/10/creativity-vs-c.html"">creativity and control</a>) will make them &quot;permissible&quot; within the enterprise.</li>

<div xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""><p>So I got a chance to host a session in <a href=""http://www.sandhill.com/sandhillgroup/team.php"">MR&#39;s</a> <a href=""http://www.cloudsummit.com/"">Cloud Summit</a> at the <a href=""http://www.computerhistory.org/"">Computer History Museum</a> yesterday on Cloud Standards.&#0160; I began by asserting that a lot of innovation/standardization activity goes through the following three phases:<br /><a href=""http://jhingran.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83432860e53ef01053584a179970b-pi"" style=""display: inline;""><img alt=""Slide1"" border=""0"" class=""at-xid-6a00d83432860e53ef01053584a179970b image-full "" src=""http://jhingran.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83432860e53ef01053584a179970b-800wi"" style=""width: 438px; height: 328px;"" title=""Slide1"" /></a>
 </p><p>Fundamentally, for first 5 years, rapid innovation does not need standards and standards might inhibit the adoption.&#0160; In the next phase, there is a distinct fear of lockin, which sometimes leads to standards, sometimes interoperability leads to standards, but eventually, the industry consolidates in this phase and standards typically emerge (such as SQL).&#0160; In the next phase, there is another period of growth, but vendors find new ways to create lockins (e.g., stored procedure languages in the database world).</p><p>So the question is, what about cloud.&#0160; My hypothesis in the pitch was the following<br /><a href=""http://jhingran.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83432860e53ef0105358c5768970c-pi"" style=""display: inline;""><img alt=""Slide4"" border=""0"" class=""at-xid-6a00d83432860e53ef0105358c5768970c image-full "" src=""http://jhingran.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83432860e53ef0105358c5768970c-800wi"" style=""width: 498px; height: 373px;"" title=""Slide4"" /></a>
 </p><p>That different layers of the cloud infrastructure are in different phases.&#0160; The bottom is more amenable to standards (such as <a href=""http://www.dmtf.org/newsroom/pr/view?item_key=3b542cbc5e6fc9ede97b9336c29f4c342c02c4e9"">OVF</a>), than one version of the middle tier is -- the version that is pushing for a new &quot;stack&quot; (such as force.com, Google app engine, Amazon S3 etc.).&#0160; However, another version of the middle-tier, which is taking traditional 3-tier apps and moving them to the cloud is already well past the standards phase, because these applications have made their decisions on Oracles, DB2&#39;s, WebSpheres and BEA&#39;s.&#0160; </p><p>It was&#0160; lively discussion and I will need to refine my hypothesis and theory, but I would welcome comments.</p><p>And more on what I saw and heard at the summit later.</p></div>

&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I was on a panel in Washington DC last week in a workshop on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dhs.gov/xinfoshare/committees/editorial_0699.shtm&quot;&gt;Privacy and Data Mining&lt;/a&gt; for Department of Homeland Security.  The topic, of course, can be quite incendiary.  But the focus of the panel was on privacy preserving data mining technology, so we kept the discussion at a technical level and avoided politics or policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;The points I made on the panel (other panelists were &lt;a href=&quot;http://portal.acm.org/author_page.cfm?id=81100204478&quot;&gt;Chris Clifton&lt;/a&gt; from Purdue, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~rebecca.wright/&quot;&gt;Rebecca Wright&lt;/a&gt; from DIMACS and Rutgers) were the following&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Commercial businesses are very much interested in this too, and this interest is driving technology innovation that can be leveraged in DHS situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;While data mining and privacy preserving aspects of it have the fiery appeal, the fact is that privacy preservation is critical across all aspects of a data lifecycle -- data at rest, data in motion, data graveyard, test, production, integration etc. -- many copies of data existing before and after the data mining. Consequently, having bullet-proof privacy preservation in the data mining &quot;part&quot; of this chain is not sufficient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That IBM and other vendors have built up a repertoire of capabilities, primarily from a commercial perspective.  I highlighted the research of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/disciplines/iis/&quot;&gt;Hippocratic Databases&lt;/a&gt; and the privacy preserving technologies in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-306.ibm.com/software/data/ips/products/masterdata/eas/&quot;&gt;Entity Analytics Solutions&lt;/a&gt; as two sets of examples of these.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
It is always risky wading into such controversial topics, but I enjoyed the panel very much, learnt from the other panelists, and equally importantly, learnt from other panels.  I think such dialogs are critical. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;I want to especially thank &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/tgrandison/&quot;&gt;Tyrone Grandison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24px; line-height: normal; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 23px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 22px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 21px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 20px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 19px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 15px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; &quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/sasha/&quot;&gt;Alexandre Evfimievski&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeffjonas.typepad.com/&quot;&gt;Jeff Jonas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10px; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 0px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 0px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 11px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; &quot;&gt;Katie Ignaszewski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 24px; line-height: normal; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 23px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 22px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 21px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 20px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 19px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 18px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 16px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 15px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 14px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13px; &quot;&gt;and our Chief Privacy Officer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/biography/10073.wss&quot;&gt;Harriet Pearson&lt;/a&gt;, for helping me with the talk and the panel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the GA of our mashup offerings, in a package called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-306.ibm.com/software/info/mashup-center/&quot;&gt;IBM Mashup Center&lt;/a&gt;, we now have the same software available for everyone to play around with on &lt;a href=&quot;http://greenhouse.lotus.com&quot;&gt;Lotus Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Go get an account and try it out, add to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/mashupswiki.nsf&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, our mashup offering is a mashup of two offerings -- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;InfoSphere MashupHub, which allows you to catalog information, and mix and match feeds -- whether they are departmental, enterprise or external.&amp;nbsp; Fundamentally, the mix and match happens by dragging and dropping feeds and wiring them together for &quot;data operations&quot; (select, joins, merge, transform etc.).&amp;nbsp; On Greenhouse, InfoSphere MashupHub can be reached &lt;a href=&quot;https://greenhouse.lotus.com/mashuphub&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lotus Mashups, which allows you to create pages (interactive views) by dragging and dropping widgets on to a palette and wiring them together.&amp;nbsp; The widgets display information (typically from InforSphere MashupHub) and/or perform different behavior based on actions in another widget.&amp;nbsp; Pages or widgets created for or in Lotus Mashups get cataloged back in InfoSphere MashupHub.&amp;nbsp; On Greehouse, Lotus Mashups can be reached &lt;a href=&quot;https://greenhouse.lotus.com/mum/enabler&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be periodicaly posting mashups on Greenhouse so that I can help explain the different use cases, but you will find many already there.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us know your feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
