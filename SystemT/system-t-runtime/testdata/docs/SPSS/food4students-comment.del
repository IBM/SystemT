81,81,Please keep Taco Bell. It’s the best thing down here!!!
82,82,"Spano’s pizza sucks, it has no flavor. It’s worse than eating cardboard. Blimpies’ subs are nasty and the service is horrible. You should bring in Subway instead. Keep the salad out longer than an hour or two. The grill itself needs to keep the orders in order instead of one person getting #36 before #10. The food needs to be hot when it’s supposed to be and preferably without hair."
83,83,Nobody wants Wendy’s food when there is a Wendy’s 2 blocks from campus within walking distance.
84,84,The heat is unbearable in the grill area. Please turn it down and get rid of the bugs.

121,121,Lots of salad bar choices including nuts. Better if they were separate for those of us with allergies.
122,122,We like Tom. Would like to have some meat choice restored to salad bar like hot pepperoni.

2209,2209,"Way too expensive Mzz sticks for amount you get. Philly is too small for $3.89 and there should be 4 chicken strips of adequate size. Replace the BBQ sauce, it is awful!! Please have bigger containers to put our sauces in."

2227,2227,I think you must have soda refills to encourage ecology at a low cost. Specialty lettuce - not just ice burg!!! Please use dark green lettuces and put out spinach more often. I do enjoy the ethnic buffets. I also appreciate your making mashed potatoes with real potatoes - not boxed. The A La Carte is a good idea.
2228,2228,Try not to serve all same types of food at same meal.

2249,2249,Lower down the price!!
2250,2250,"Better healthier food. Better prices. This campus steals your points by double sliding your card through the register. They also charge you for phantom drinks. For example if you get the combo and a bottled drink instead of a fountain drink, you still are charged for the fountain drink you never got. Also, things on this campus are grossly over priced. Last night I got a chicken breast, mashed potatoes and a biscuit, a drink (bottled) and some candy."

2270,2270,"I was charged $12! For double the price I could have gotten a family meal from KFC with more chicken, more biscuits and two sides. I also would use the dining facilities more often if I was allowed to go there. By that I mean the stupid commuter hours. Instead of building a study lounge, they should have used that money so they could have expanded the food area so commuters and residents could have the same hours and I wouldn't have to wait until 2 pm to get a tuna melt."

2279,2279,"Change food, less fried food."
2280,2280,The food is overpriced and the drinks should be colder.

Twice I have asked at around 10:30 to get a whole pizza and he has said no because he said wasting food was a sin. If the Den is ""open"" until 11:30, why is making a whole pizza - no matter what the waste - a problem?"
2452,2452,"Why does the grill downstairs close? When do the different counters close upstairs in Newell? Why aren't the times posted? Last Saturday I rolled into Newell 2 minutes before it officially opened (according to the clock there) and a guy swiped my card and let me in. Food was out, everything was ready so I served myself. While we were walking away, the manager with shoulder length braids came running out and yelled, ""What the fuck are you doing? We are not open and you are in here..."" She cussed at us until one of her managers came out and told her, ""That is enough."", No apology at all. Where is the concern for the students?"

2483,2483,"Better night staff. Cleaner cooking areas. I have had multiple, very negative experiences with the night staff at the grill. They tend to be rude, use foul and offensive language and seem to not want to be there most of the time. I know many people who will not eat in the Den because of this issue and it really should not be a problem. The day time staff are friendly, polite and serve the food in a timely manner. At night it seems the grill area is very messy. Continued on next line."
2484,2484,"Continued from previous line. I once witnessed an employee who made a customer cry because they were out of veggie burgers and couldn't offer another vegetarian substitute. The employee then proceeded to try to give her a turkey burger and pretend it was a veggie burger, then referred her to another employee with a curse word.

2514,2514,"The Den should offer corn dogs. Also, there should be two pricings for sandwiches. I don't like my sandwiches to be over stuffed with 2 inches of meat. I also don't like lettuce and tomatoes, etc. so a sandwich for me contains much less than what they offer. I feel that I am paying a lot more than others."

2532,2532,"Smaller hash browns, not home fries. Idaho Falls food is BAD. Hamburgers are raw as is the chicken. Need better food section. Offer more choices. The place in IF needs to have a set up like Pocky. They also need more help. Their food is raw and not tasty. I find myself not eating there because of their NASTY food.

7092,7092,Lower prices on groceries.
7093,7093,I’m not satisfied with the soup and salad tran. I think the amount of soup and salad is targeted towards female dieters and there is no way a soup and salad will fill me up like a sub.
7094,7094,Make stuff more reasonable priced.
7095,7095,Put 1% milk on supply list.

7116,7116,Something besides subs. There are 3 sub places on campus!

7118,7118,"Have music in the store. Have green peppers, black olives and guacamole on sub line. Have more options for meal transfers (besides subs, pizza and salad). Hot dog, cheeseburger, fries, more fruit, have salads, noodle, potato, as part of a meal transfer. Post when meal times change for customers."
7119,7119,"Get rid of the franchises, go independent. Reason: more control over food variety."
7120,7120,Enable students with meal plan to use more than one transfer at a time because one sub or pizza is not enough food for a meal!
7121,7121,I think that the extra transfers you don’t use should be added to the following week. Also no limit when you use your transfers.
7122,7122,The non-transfer food is a rip off! $5 for a box of cereal! Lower all non-transfer products prices. We should be able to use transfer at any time.
7123,7123,Increase the variety of food with lower prices.
7124,7124,"Lower prices, e.g. overpriced fruit, salads."

7135,7135,"More types of red meat (steak, bear.)"
7136,7136,"We should be able to use as many meals as we want at any one time. We paid for them, they should be ours to use as we please."
7137,7137,"Lower food prices at Prairie St to better compete with the other stores, restaurants, and supermarkets."
7138,7138,"The Stop Gap needs to have a little more variety for food, and also the prices are just way too high. Crack down on the stealers!"
7139,7139,"Offer fat free mayo at counter where sandwiches are made. Offer celery sticks for sale, like carrots are."
7140,7140,"Maybe offer more “low fat” items. “Low fat” ice cream, snacks and other items. More vegetables (fresh) too."
7141,7141,"Nothing, because there is already nowhere else to go. This place is much better than the dining hall."
7142,7142,I think the prices are a big high.
7143,7143,"Keep up on cleaning dining area. And put thought into changing Styrofoam cups, paper instead!"
7144,7144,Cleanliness of dining area.
7145,7145,"Maybe if there was more food included in meal transfers, i.e. soup, salad, and breadsticks, or more nutritious choices."
7146,7146,"Pizza box and breadsticks timed, and taped pizza boxes."
7147,7147,Changing employee’s gloves every once in a while so jalapeno juice doesn’t get on the tomatoes.

7159,7159,Not charging extra for cheese on BLT’s.
7160,7160,"I’d like diet Dr. Pepper for meal transfers. Cheddar cheese for subs and maybe like a nachos option, we also don’t have English muffins. I wish we could use our transfers whenever we’d like. Sometimes I’d like to heave subs and pizza. I think we should be able to use our transfers when we want, especially since so many of us are gone on the weekends. Guest transfers should be useable at any time. My parents or friends who come during the week, I’m not able to treat."
7161,7161,"Competition, get other companies."
7162,7162,"Hire more attractive looking girls. Girl workers should look scandalous. If this is done, profits will increase two fold."
7163,7163,"Girl workers should be required to wear skirts with thongs, so when they bend over half their ass is showing. I would come and eat twice a day."
7164,7164,Big boobs are better boobs.
7165,7165,"More events such as dances, karaoke nights, cheaper prices would be good."

7173,7173,"With a meal transfer, instead of getting a bag of chips, how about substituting chips for a fruit. Or have it an option for students."
7174,7174,All the same food and subs get old to eat when we eat the same things every day. Try new things!

7177,7177,"I would like the milk cooler, kept colder."

7182,7182,Overall cost of the meal plan itself.

If somebody didn’t want chicken, they go hungry for the night. Secondly the minute I came down here I wanted to leave because of the music. I despise that rap/reggae/R&B shit. It’s bad enough people play it while I’m studying, and I have to hear it every time I go out. I’ve even heard it often during regular dinner. Now it’s playing so loud that I can’t even talk to the person next to me. If I wanted to go to a nightclub I’d go downtown. At least then I’d be drunk enough to tolerate this disgrace to the music industry. Not everybody likes this music; in fact I know a lot of people that think it’s shit and are sick of hearing it.

8107,8107,"Employees who are nicer, and who cook the food all the way. Cleaner facilities are needed."
8108,8108,More chocolate!
8109,8109,"Make meal plans optional for students. Quality of food isn’t bad, but the value is incredibly inferior to the other similar establishments. Meal plans are too expensive for what you get!"
8110,8110,"Get better grilled chicken, no fish stuff no one likes it. Give out 2 pieces of chicken instead of one per counter visit, get consistently good turkey, have better low fat dressing, healthier choices, add bacon sandwich central. Cookies and cream frozen yogurt. More pineapple, fruit selection, juices."
8111,8111,"Variety for vegetarians, health nuts and those with acid reflux."
8112,8112,I think students should not be required to purchase a meal plan. Some students prefer to make/buy their own food.

8131,8131,Try not to get bugs on the dining room and try to create more variety of food.
8132,8132,"Turn unused meals on plan into dining dollars, would increase meal purchases at food court. Sauces (tomato and teriyaki) need to be thicker and richer, taste watered down. No more laxatives in the food."
8133,8133,More of a variety of food like steak.
8134,8134,The ladies at the front are very nice.

8150,8150,Better quality beef.
8151,8151,Variety.
8152,8152,24 hours.
8153,8153,More food representing the cultures of <illegible>.
8154,8154,"My only comment is that while we seem to have a variety of food, the variety stays the same and after a while it is no longer variety."
8155,8155,"Get the horrible food smell from the facility; in other words, have better ventilation."
8156,8156,"I love the yellow peppers station. I enjoy having so many stations to choose form, but the stations basically serve the same thing everyday. I would like more variety in veggies at the salad bar. Scrambled eggs are often under or over cooked. Your staff is great!"
8157,8157,Music in the dining hall area.
8158,8158,"Everything is great but may I suggest an extra helper for Ms. Michelle making the omelets? It gets full sometimes (most of the time actually) and maybe she could use some help so it won’t be so overwhelming. Also, have patties for employees."
8159,8159,"More beverages, the only variety we have is of sodas."
8160,8160,More variety on the weekends.
8161,8161,"Meat ravioli, higher quality chicken and beef for stir-fry, diet cream soda."
8162,8162,If certain wait times (i.e. stir fry) were shorter. And if the dining was less crowded at peak eating times.
8163,8163,Omelets are the best when Michelle makes them!
8164,8164,Make more stuff with buffalo sauce.

8167,8167,Great job!
8168,8168,Grilled chicken at the grill!
8169,8169,"More variety is good, I would like to see fish on a more regular basis. Although the stuffed fish is not very good, however, the swordfish is always excellent."
8170,8170,"More food options, especially vegetarian, vegan."
8171,8171,"More variety, more options."
8172,8172,"Make the food better, more consistently."
8173,8173,More choices but only add do not subtract.
8174,8174,"More variety of meat in some nights, cleaner uniforms for cooks, spatulas and towels in the egg section during breakfast are dirty (it doesn’t look very nice.)"
8175,8175,Increase quality of food.
8176,8176,I think you need a better selection for “home cooked” food like more chicken/steak. Not ethnic.
8177,8177,More variety.
8178,8178,Gatorade or other drink with electrolytes.
8179,8179,"Availability of healthy choices like dark green (non-iceberg) lettuce, more veggies, fresher. I really like the vegetarian options this year!"
8180,8180,More variety of vegetables and better preparation of them.
8181,8181,Have peanut butter and jelly and fluff more.
8182,8182,White meat tuna.
8183,8183,The website should be up to date with the proper food items that will be served. Sometimes when it is wrong there might not be something I want to eat.
8184,8184,"More variety, and make Earl smile, he never does so."
8185,8185,"Longer hours, especially for lunch and dinner."
8186,8186,Breakfast at Founders Hall! (Don’t need mid-day time). More crepes.
8187,8187,The milk has been tasting like it is overly fortified with chemicals (it doesn’t taste like milk at all). Breakfast at Founders.
8188,8188,Breakfast at Founders. More crepes.
8189,8189,Good food.
8190,8190,More variety and better quality food.
8191,8191,Other fries on a regular basis (every Wednesday maybe.)
8192,8192,Breakfast at Founders. More crepes.
8193,8193,"A cheaper meal plan! Currently, the cheapest is the 190, which is 1900 per semester, even with 100 bonus dollars, that is over $9/meal. Also, no one uses all 190 meals (which also highlights the ridiculousness of a 19 meal plan). So the average cost/meal is about $10. Living on my own during the summer, I spent 50-80 on groceries per week. That’s $10 per day. Even if I had fast food for every meal (which in my opinion is the quality of the burgers/pizza/sandwiches). It wouldn’t ever cost $10. (Subway subs are $6 and Wendy’s $.99. bacon cheeseburgers are just as good as the ones served here.) <continued>"
8194,8194,"<continuation> the basic fact is that I didn’t even consider on campus housing this year simply because I can’t afford a meal plan. I perhaps would consider a “100 meal” plan for $1000/semester. In my opinion, this would not result in significant revenue loss, since the majority of meal plan holders live in dorms and are therefore freshmen. Most parents saying goodbye to sons and daughters would insist on a plan that at least appeared to be substantial."
8195,8195,More fish and seafood choices.
8196,8196,"Hard ice cream, simple meals (like baked chicken), less soupy mashed potatoes, completely cooked grilled chicken (no pink!)"
8197,8197,Better pasta sauce.
8198,8198,"Better selection of entrees because I never get the entrées, and better salad bar, the lettuce is always awful."
8199,8199,Have grilled chicken and low fat/healthier options.
8200,8200,"More vegan! Whole wheat food! Don’t require meal plan, refill orange juice more often."
8201,8201,Earl is too grumpy and won’t make eggs for me.
8202,8202,More selection.
8203,8203,"More variety, bacon at the sandwich counter, more variety in hot lunches."
8204,8204,"More variety of foods, some of the ‘experimental’ dishes are very good."
8205,8205,"Better meals, more turkey, less lamb and ethnic foods. Meal plans should carry over to next semester or unused meal should be redeemable for something."
8206,8206,Better salad dressings (creamy Italian is a must).
8207,8207,"More muffins and assorted breads, like whole grains. Healthier cereals. Basic 4, Bran/Raisin Flakes."
8208,8208,Maybe dinner should go later like at Founders.
8209,8209,"I’d like more alfredo sauce with pasta, always having chicken noodle soup and/or cheese and broccoli soup."
8210,8210,Orange soda.
8211,8211,"Longer hours, more healthy options."
8212,8212,"Something like having Terra Ve for lunch, but Menutainment for dinner. I enjoyed the taco bar, potato bar and fajita bar. I would rather have those options available at dinner instead of lunch."
8213,8213,"Omelets available longer in the morning. More food in a “grab and go”, low fat or no fat salad dressings."
8214,8214,"Omelets for longer in the morning, different chips in “grab and go”. A fat free dressing, more themed dinners, ex Hawaiian night, Oriental night, holidays, etc."
8215,8215,A greater variety of food choices.
8216,8216,More variety.
8217,8217,Offer meals like fish and lamb less often. Make dishes more appealing visually.
8218,8218,"Simpler foods for example if you serve some fancy kind of chicken, leave some pieces plain for picky eaters. More variety in cereals in Founders. Bring back hard ice cream at Founders."
8219,8219,Longer hours!
8220,8220,"More reasonable pricing for resident meal plans. As it stands, a person paying at the door for daily meals can end up spending less per year than a person with a plan."
8221,8221,"Lower cost, better entrees, I hardly ever eat the “main” entrees, only sandwiches/grill/pizza."
8222,8222,"Get low fat Colombo frozen yogurt; more healthy entrees/no cream, less pasta, more veggies. Less tempeh, more tofu; less fried food; cereals with less sugar; soups that are broth, not cream based, good fruit selection (ripe)."
8223,8223,"Keep the Colombo non-fat strawberry frozen yogurt and have more entrees without cream, healthier choices, soups without cream, broth based instead."
8224,8224,Tofu should be sliced thinner and cooked and marinated longer. We need rainbow sprinkles in Morgan.
8225,8225,"More normal food choices, boneless/skinless chicken, a warmer dining room (it’s too cold)."
8226,8226,"Flexibility in meal plans. (i.e. 75 meal for residents who do not utilize facilities often). Longer hours (later dinner). More normal soups (chicken noodle, /rice, tomato."
8227,8227,More variety of fruits! Don’t get the milks mixed up. The line for custom sandwiches is always too long.
8228,8228,"Make sure hamburgers are well cooked, longer hours would be nice, with breakfast lasting longer than till just 8:45."
8229,8229,"Better food for vegetarian, more choices."
8230,8230,If breakfast hours lasted until lunch.
8231,8231,Moving off campus so I won’t use it.
8232,8232,More mint chocolate chip ice cream. Midnight breakfasts.
8233,8233,Me not—moving off campus.
8234,8234,"Given I eat here every day, I can't eat here more often, no matter what you do. QED."
8235,8235,Well sometimes I think you try to be too fancy. Tone down the fanciness and ensure taste.
8236,8236,I don’t like your plain French fries.
8237,8237,"Stocking these things: soymilk, tofutti ice cream, tofutti better than cream cheese, fake meats."
8238,8238,"Grilled chicken, omelets all day. Sugar free dessert. Later hours for dinner! Low carb options, vinaigrette dressing."
8239,8239,Improve the taste and flavor of food. Needs more variety type of food.
8240,8240,Better Chinese food.
8241,8241,The only time I utilize facilities is when someone offers me a free meal here.
8242,8242,Facilities are good. Would like more healthy choices.
8243,8243,Dinner until 8 or 9 p.m.
8244,8244,"Change the service hours, dinner should be later."
8245,8245,"Work on improving quality of the food, not quantity. Founders dining hall has less selection but much better food."
8246,8246,"I am a runner and am very active. I eat all 3 meals but am often hungry in between meals and don’t keep food in my room. I will take fruit to suck on but sometimes would like other things to eat. Maybe you could make a snack bar at the front desk so that people could use their points to get health snack food in between meals? Maybe it could be open later too! With ROTC we don’t get back from drill at Holy Cross until late, maybe the dining halls could stay open until 7? People with sports have to leave on Saturdays before the Hill opens so they don’t get food either."

10448,10448,I eat there from 9-3:00. The ladies that work are wonderful.

11386,11386,If I got hungry more.
11387,11387,"Change Chars into a Pizza Hut, change Blimpie's into a Subway, and offer better food at Whitney."
11388,11388,It’s good.
11389,11389,Closer to Laux.
11390,11390,"Nothing, it’s good!"

11398,11398,More variety and fresh food.
11399,11399,"Better quality for price, and try not to profit so much."

11402,11402,Cheese.

11408,11408,Get hot Asian cooks to wear bikinis and serve my food.
11409,11409,Temperature of food could improve.

11411,11411,Quicker when the fries run out.
11412,11412,Keep the Cellar cleaner.
11413,11413,Have the food hot when served. The heat lamp doesn’t work. Better beef would make better burgers.

11416,11416,Better transfer hours.

11422,11422,Food needs to be hotter.
11423,11423,It seems I am always waiting in line forever. And not getting what I want when my turn!
11424,11424,I love all the staff. They are the best.
11425,11425,"Nothing, the atmosphere is great!"

11468,11468,More meaty foods or instead of pizza on veggie day with no meat have it on another day so the pizza will have meat.
11469,11469,Better food.
11470,11470,More fruit. Meat products. Fresh salad.
11471,11471,"I use it whenever I’m here. Meal times are a little difficult though, another half hour at dinner would help."
11472,11472,Better everything.
11473,11473,Open more.
11474,11474,"No more veggie Thursdays, lunch items at brunch, better quality breakfast items."

11476,11476,Better food.
11477,11477,More good food.
11478,11478,"Keep hot dishes hot, often too cool. Dish and silver sometimes not clean, provide cold cuts on Thursdays (veggie day)."
11479,11479,"Warmer food, less vegetarian choices."
11480,11480,"More variety, more low carb choices."
11481,11481,"The only problem I have is that the food is never hot! Sometimes veggies are still cold, like they never got heated thru."
11482,11482,"More information about food contents: calories, etc."
11483,11483,Better tasting food would be nice. Hot food would be a treat.
11484,11484,"I believe I would utilize the dining facilities more if Conserve School invested in a higher quality meal plan. I thoroughly believe Mark and his staff are doing their very best with the resources they have. I have worked in other boarding schools and have dined in many boarding schools as a guest and it is clear that the overall quality of food and available of choice is far better at other schools. Excellent meal plan cost money though. But they pay off in community satisfaction (student, faculty, staff). But I am speaking as someone who really values a superior dining experience. Others may not care so much."
11485,11485,"Meal service for breakfast on weekends, i.e., both breakfast and lunch on Saturdays and Sundays."
11486,11486,"Larger variety of hot breakfast foods on daily. Continue lunches and dinners, always need a quality vegetarian option, consider more Mexican options regularly. Always offer at least 2 entrée options as well."
11487,11487,Hot food and more variety would help.
11488,11488,"Choices always seem the same, need variety. Use more sauce in  your dishes (ex. Ravioli, spaghetti dishes). Have actual meatballs with spaghetti instead of tofu. Too much of the no meat stuff. We’re in Wisconsin, where’s the beef? Beef or Italian sausage."
11489,11489,"More meat, better quality food."
11490,11490,More choices.
11491,11491,More open hours.
11492,11492,More lines!
11493,11493,Make sure all utensils are clean!
11494,11494,"The food often tries to be too complex, but cafeteria food isn’t good unless it’s simple and tasty as well as nutritious. Basically the food is bad and needs to get better. Service is fine, but those eggs I ate this morning sucked."
11495,11495,More options!
11496,11496,Continue with providing fruit between meals.
11497,11497,Leave human head hair out of the chicken fajitas.

11499,11499,Better food.
11500,11500,A lot of the food sucks!
11501,11501,"Meat alternative on veggie day. Vegans always have an alternative, why can’t I?"
11502,11502,The taste and flavor of the food could be better. Also having a different variety of food each day and better food during the weekends.
11503,11503,The help in Brough is great! Jens is the best and she brightens up my day!
11504,11504,Having a more variety of food between ‘lunch’ time and ‘dinner’ time.

11508,11508,More healthy choices that are not horrible tasting.
11509,11509,"The food needs to be healthier; the healthy stuff like vegetables are way too greasy and buttery. Plain corn is good, don’t need butter-corn soup."
11510,11510,"Better food; more variety, move Jens – let Jens mingle."
11511,11511,"Less carbs and grain foods, more fruits and vegetables."
11512,11512,Change the food you offer every semester instead of having the same thing for certain days for a whole year.
11513,11513,"Low fat options, there are some, but very few. Fulbright should be open seven days a week, Brough and Fulbright should be open longer."
11514,11514,A large variety of good foods.
11515,11515,No more fake eggs. I would be pleased to see real scrambled eggs. The ice cream is really soggy when the machine is working. I like Fulbright’s way of serving ice cream.
11516,11516,"Have more real food (eggs, meat.) Meat is very important to the human body, and I don’t feel like Brough is accommodating that need."
11517,11517,More variety of foods during weekends.
11518,11518,Food on the weekends needs more variety. Indian cuisine would also be nice.
11519,11519,"Cheaper meal plan, more variety in food, more steak, shrimp nights, longer hours, more variety on weekends, chili every day of the week."
11520,11520,Make it all free.
11521,11521,More fajita type food and chicken strip type neutral foods.
11522,11522,"I mean, I have to eat in here because I have to buy a meal plan. I would eat in here a lot more instead of wasting my money, if the food was better. More chicken strips, improve the taste of the food you already prepare."
11523,11523,Better food quality.
11524,11524,Better and faster food.
11525,11525,"Cleanliness, decent food quality, basic common-sense goals met (cleaning vegetables), some actual nutrition (not veggies drenched in butter)."
11526,11526,Better food.
11527,11527,Better food and normal food.
11528,11528,Better food; normal food.
11529,11529,"Patty melts are good but make some without onions, buy new plates and silverware or buy new dishwasher/fix ice cream machine. Use real eggs (not those nasty sunny side up eggs. Cook bacon all the way. Stop drying out the chicken (fried/baked/whatever). Pour the grease off the sausage. Sometime the Italian dressing tastes funny (be consistent with the flavor). Fresh fruit (not fruit that has been sitting around and being used as decoration for a month and keep them cold."
11530,11530,Have alcoholic beverages for those students/guests who are of age.
11531,11531,Overall quality of food and taste variety.
11532,11532,"More food choices (changes in food choice through out week in more than one line). Food need to be hotter, it gets cold by the time you sit down."
11533,11533,More variety in food choices and better quality of food.
11534,11534,"More selection, better meat. Compared to what I could pay on my own at a grocery store, the food is not good at all, but because I live on campus I have to purchase a meal plan."
11535,11535,Better food on weekends; ice cream machines that work! And chocolate syrup!
11536,11536,"Better food, the food sucks (really bad). It is a waste of $6.50."
11537,11537,"Later hours, especially on weekends."
11538,11538,"Lower prices, better music, get some Sparks and Crazy Straws. Will increase my likelihood of dining here again."
11539,11539,Play music college students can actually listen to without throwing up! This defeats the purpose of the dining hall!
11540,11540,More chicken.
11541,11541,"Don’t put pepper on everything, e.g. vegetables,  better if pepper was on the side."
11542,11542,Keep the food hot and make sure the ice cream machine is always working.
11543,11543,"If, every day, they hid 20 dollar bills in random food items, such as pies and hard-boiled eggs."
11544,11544,"More variety, better quality specifically with meat, open more hours in the morning on Sunday, more meal plan options. It goes from unlimited to 15 with no choice in-between. There should be a 20 option or something of that nature."
11545,11545,Having crab and meat all you ever have is chicken!
11546,11546,More meat besides chicken.
11547,11547,Better food quality and wider variety. It is hard to get a tasty meal here that is healthy.
11548,11548,"Serving of better food on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Dinner doesn’t have good variety on these days. Make sure cokes and other drinks aren’t watered down. Also make sure silverware is clean."
11549,11549,Better tasting and higher quality meat.
11550,11550,Serve what the students request. Serve food that tastes good and looks good (as opposed to a huge pile of stuff that I don’t know what it is.)
11551,11551,"Real eggs when scrambled, low fat salad dressing. Higher quality of prepared food (i.e., n/a salads, fruit/veggies, but rather multiple ingredient dishes.) steamed veggies, not oil-cooked. Honey as a condiment, for bread."
11552,11552,More variety each day.
11553,11553,"Lemons, baked potatoes every day."
11554,11554,Lemons for water and baked potatoes every day.
11555,11555,I want the managers to walk around and ask people what they think.
11556,11556,Go check out the dining facility at the University of Oklahoma and notice the high quality of food. Bring that same quality back here and I would continue to utilize the dining facility.
11557,11557,"Less cheese, it’s in everything! And follow cooking instructions. Cook the potatoes longer. Keep serving cheesecake and cream pie."
11558,11558,Better food.
11559,11559,I don’t feel that the dining facility (Brough) is the best place for the mentally/physically challenged people to cook. Sometimes I see them touching themselves and then the food and it’s very unsanitary and it makes me not want to eat the food.
11560,11560,If dining services were open for dinner later (excluding late night).
11561,11561,Healthier food choices. More chicken that is not fried.
11562,11562,I would change the hours of operation. They need to be extended.
11563,11563,Price decrease and music change.
11564,11564,"If you stop serving so much pork, I would eat here more. The music also sucks. Have more dishes with chicken in them, for not everyone can eat beef and pork due to cultural/religious dietary restrictions."
11565,11565,Better quality/tasting food. Meal plans are expensive and I don’t feel that I get my money’s worth sometimes.
11566,11566,If the burgers tasted. If they had any taste at all.
11567,11567,More choices and better food.
11568,11568,Make sure Bob cooks the eggs in the morning! He’s the best! We need more juice choices! Cranberry! Please!
11569,11569,"Variety of vegetables and meats, there’s too much junk to choose from."
11570,11570,"Stick to the basics. Rosemary, cherry, pineapple grilled chicken. Not good. Barbeque chicken good."
11571,11571,To-go cups.
11572,11572,Make the meal plan cheaper.
11573,11573,"Have raspberry lemonade. Don’t have so many weird vegetables like okra, gumbo, etc. just have normal vegetables. I am a vegetarian and am glad you try to accommodate that, but some of those things are too out there. We like fresh baked cookies but we’d like them for dinner too."
11574,11574,"The overall cleanliness of the dining area seems to have gotten worse recently, also there is more vegetarian selection, but there could still be more!"
11575,11575,If my meals rolled over one week and I could use the extra meals the next week if I needed! Better sandwich meats! More ‘healthy’ foods for breakfast!
11576,11576,"A better sandwich stuff, bread, cheese, meat). Variety and better quality."
11577,11577,More vegetarian offerings. At least one vegetarian soup per day.
11578,11578,"Better, healthier, fresher variety, close when you say you’ll close, please not before. Pay attention to what people like and stock more of that."

11580,11580,"Better stuff, healthier food."
11581,11581,More Mario.
11582,11582,Lower prices.
11583,11583,Rice on weekends.
11584,11584,No more surveys.
11585,11585,Cashiers hotter.
11586,11586,Better food.
11587,11587,Lower prices.
11588,11588,Nicer uniforms.
11589,11589,"Lower prices, use of non-Styrofoam containers."
11590,11590,The quality of food and price for instance a small piece of pound cake is $1.50 which the whole cake you can get it for $2-3.
11591,11591,"Please lessen the amount of grease used in the grill. It looks and tastes disgusting. I cannot afford the $950 meal plan, it is too much for me, and I never use them up until the end of semester. There should be more wide range of price of meal plan."
11592,11592,"More convenient hours, better prices on certain overpriced products."
11593,11593,Get better tasting chicken.
11594,11594,A return to the menu options of last semester.
11595,11595,Bigger selection of diet beverages.
11596,11596,"More variety, cheaper prices."
11597,11597,"More for your money, vegetarian and healthy options, bigger variety."
11598,11598,"Soymilk, vegetarian options, more sandwich bar."
11599,11599,They should stay late so everyone can buy food all day like from 7 a.m. – 10 p.m.
11600,11600,"Better food for vegetarians, soymilk, vegetarian yogurt."
11601,11601,"Low carb bars! Advantage bars are good. Diet caffeine free soda, low carb Slim Fast, baklava, soymilk."
11602,11602,Bring back the baklava! Why do you take away food that people obviously like and buy a lot of? Please try not to run out of water anymore.
11603,11603,Less grease! Lard is not a seasoning.
11604,11604,"Prices are often ridiculous. Fruit, especially. Definitely more Joe. Soymilk."
11605,11605,"More vegetarian options, healthy snack options."
11606,11606,Prices are too expensive for the amount we get and there needs More variety. Soymilk.
11607,11607,More variety and cheaper food.
11608,11608,"More meat selections and vegetarian yogurt with Baco Bits and soymilk with meat chunks, nicer food staff."
11609,11609,"Soymilk, vegetarian yogurt (no gelatin)! Sandwich bar more often."
11610,11610,"By the end of the week, you have little food left. Your variety is lackluster. You guys are a dining facility not a snack bar. Soymilk."
11611,11611,There needs to be longer hours.
11612,11612,"Lower prices, more Joe, less Keneisha, better food, faster services. Hotter women."
11613,11613,Soymilk.
11614,11614,Staff is helpful!
11615,11615,Must be open more (longer) and have some sort of night facility.
11616,11616,"Hours suck! More weekend hours. More ethnic cuisine, weekend needs fresh food. Food at Main Entrée is always lukewarm."
11617,11617,Too salty and oily.
11618,11618,"If there was a Sbarro’s, etc in it. If it was open longer. 5:30 p.m. on weekends is too early."
11619,11619,"More appropriate prices for food. Especially prepackaged food. More healthy food options daily. Fresh fruit daily. Hot entrees could be kept higher temps. Typically these are lukewarm. More weekend food selections, weekend foods are limited and mostly recognizable “leftovers” form the week. A better selection of tea bags would be amenable as well."
11620,11620,"We fill these damn surveys out every semester and nothing ever changes. Stop wasting my time. Paul sucks at the grill. Nice guy, slow cook. I’ve waited up to ½ hour for food. Not acceptable. I’ve requested baked Lays for a month from Larry and we still don’t have them. They are 1-½ grams of fat per bag. Most of the other chips are closer to 9 or 10. Thank you for adding tofu to the menu, but then it’s prepared in such a way that I’ve given up trying it! Jerk tofu? I would like the stir-fries Debra does to include a tofu sub. And brown rice sub. Food is grossly overpriced to the extent that it has become a running campus joke. $3 for a Slim Fast bar! Are you kidding! $1.85 for fruit! $1.65 for yogurt! $3.99 for a Healthy Choice TV dinner, which is often the only healthy choice of food available. Like I said, if nothing is going to change, don’t ask me to fill these out. Thanks."
11621,11621,Lower prices.
11622,11622,The quality of the meats and vegetables in the café are worse than food in prison.
11623,11623,"Using foods that are lower in fat/calories, more sandwich options baked Doritos! Swedish fish! Chicken fingers!"
11624,11624,"Use less grease, use no dark meat for pastas and stir-fries, add chicken fingers to the grill menu!"
11625,11625,Fire new grill guy.
11626,11626,"Better hours, earlier on weekends, later on Fridays."
11627,11627,"Stop getting rid of everything that sells. Stop overcharging. Keep longer hours. Give Joe, Antoinette and Millicent praise and raises."
11628,11628,Extend hours.
11629,11629,"Better quality and selection of food, later hours, friendlier staff, more reasonable prices."
11630,11630,"Longer hours would be nice, especially on weekends. Do you think we don’t eat on Friday, Saturday, Sunday or something? I sometimes don’t get out of class until 8:30, then I can’t eat. Cheaper prices! Food that looks good tastes like poo! Very rarely good food from non-grill."
11631,11631,"Food variety, taste and flavor and price."
11632,11632,More variety (not just chicken or beef).
11633,11633,Prices are increasingly “too” high. It’s very disappointing to find some products you are making three times profit off of students.
11634,11634,Better hot sauce.
11635,11635,"Better quality or at least cheaper prices for bad food. More options, more sandwiches and health conscious food. It seems like everything is fried. I am trying to avoid the freshmen 15."
11636,11636,More selection and healthier foods.
11637,11637,"More variety, better quality meals, healthier food, cleaner cooking surfaces (I got food poisoning from there!)"
11638,11638,"Variety of food offered to students when they are forced to have a meal plan. In addition, the quality of the food could use improvement for the price. I am a very healthy eater and I do to eat much meat, I found it very difficult to find good healthy meals."
11639,11639,"The variety in food choices has gotten much better, so I can’t complain."
11640,11640,Better food! More variety of food. Better price/quality. Better service on weekends.

Please avoid making funny soups like creamy tuna noodle, and please make the soup fresh and not from leftovers. Please offer the pork roast, beef roast, and steak more often. Please do not use grade D meat. Offer breakfast items at grill for every meal. (Breakfast is very good). Please don’t over cook the cookies, offer items such as cheesecake, the 7 layer double chocolate cake more often than just premium nights. <continued>"
11861,11861,"<continuation>I believe that since I paid for my meals in advance I should be able to have them roll over if I don’t use them. Also I should be able to use them how I want, so if I want to buy a friend a meal I can use my meals and not my munch money. Using your policy now it would only be fair for me to be refunded the money form the meals I don’t use. I understand that there is a lot of wasted food, but if the quality of the food is improved it will bring more people in and there will be less food wasted."

11878,11878,"More variety, every month is the same menu. Keep the tator tot casserole coming. Better soups; bring back the stir-fry bar on Mondays and Wednesdays. Some foods too bland, others too spicy, taste it. More premium nights, the Mardi Gras one wasn’t good! And shouldn’t have counted. Have breakfast at dinner, the grill items because breakfast is the best meal you offer here. Offer cheesecake on other nights besides just premium nights. Meals should be able to buy other people meals and should roll over week to week and semester to semester. If you can’t get your money back at the end of the semester, you should at least be able to keep your meals! And use them how you want. Lastly the cheese sticks are overpriced at Towers! P.S. Thanks for getting the cheddar dogs at the grill though, those are good!"

11906,11906,It’s better than last semester. But some days the only good things are the hamburgers.
11907,11907,"Why so much fish? (Cod). I would open the salad/stir fry, etc station every day a week instead of just two days a week. Why serve things that most of us haven’t even heard of! It makes me not want to come down. Better choices of fruits and veggies!"
11908,11908,Cheaper.
11909,11909,"We can tell when it’s leftovers, and we think it’s disgusting."

13194,13194,Keep breakfast open later. I eat in the café not the dining hall. 9:30 is really early to close for breakfast. Push to 1030. That’s generally the end of breakfast.
13195,13195,Lower prices.
13196,13196,"Price of beverages is more expensive than machines, so everyone buys from the machines."
13197,13197,"Very good, love this place."
13198,13198,Wonderful job for price we pay.
13199,13199,Just have more options. $5 per meal is a lot for us to pay so make it healthier and wroth it.

13241,13241,A.M. assistance for the order/cook.
13242,13242,"The prices need to be lower although it’s the only café on campus, and you guys can charge what you want. Just be fair, students can’t afford much."
13243,13243,Add debit/credit card machine for paying.
13244,13244,"A few more healthy choices, more flavors of baked chips, healthier café menu items."
13245,13245,"More staff, staff that are better trained to deal with the public, especially the people who work the grill."

13265,13265,Bigger value.
13266,13266,Thanks!
13267,13267,You need more healthy choices. Not so much fried foods. Healthier cereal like “Very Berry by Kellogg’s”. Less garlic in foods.
13268,13268,The food must taste better. Breakfast is wonderful because of Roosevelt. Lunch and dinner need a lot of work.
13269,13269,Longer hours!
13270,13270,Food is a lot better than 3 years ago.
13271,13271,Let students have the ability to take food “to go” in carry out boxes.

13284,13284,More food.
13285,13285,"Make back room into smoking area, video arcade."
13286,13286,"Better food. As of late, choice is lacking, as is taste. I’ve been eating only salads someday two."

13288,13288,"In the middle, getting bigger portions of food."

13307,13307,"Less fattening food, better quality products. More nutritious foods like sushi, better fruits and veggies, soymilk, if you have three meals in a day, you can use them whenever you want. If you skip breakfast, you don’t skip a meal."
13308,13308,If I had more money.
13309,13309,"Increase taste of food, and adjust the price accordingly."
13310,13310,"Macon coffee for breakfast at 8. Topping should go on side so we can still take the food. Brunch should cost the same as lunch price. The 3 meals a day should be able to be used whenever, even at the same time."

One time I asked an Estes worker what one of the entrees were, they proceeded to open it up, look inside, then shrugged her shoulders as if she didn’t know. Also, before we go on break, Estes seems to be out of everything from bagels to cereal (the main things I eat here) although I understand that economically the facility should not buy food before a long break, but remember we are still paying for the dining services."
13317,13317,I like the wraps every day. Try having breakfast burritos for breakfast. Make some new stuff for breakfast.
13318,13318,"Less veggie dishes. If there is already a salad bar, why is a salad station every day? Less stir-fry more Mexican dishes. If you serve breakfast in the morning don’t serve it for dinner. Thank God for the George Forman at the sandwich bar. Ms. Connie rocks! Ideas for appetizers, fried cheese sticks, potato skins, fried shrimp, fried scallops. Love Wednesday. Stop the stir-fry every night."
13319,13319,"Edible food, however, nice serving staff, middle area, good food."
13320,13320,"Food being served on time, and a bigger variety."
13321,13321,Hours could be longer.

13324,13324,More vegetables.
13325,13325,"Better food. Stop all the vegetarian, international foods because no one eats them."

13331,13331,"No more Weight Watchers week! Offer more non-meat dishes on Friday during Lent to be sensitive to those who have religious obligations. Less Chinese food. More westernized dishes. More variety for dinner and lunch. Grilled cheese and paninis are not sufficient. Turkey dinners, mashed potatoes, stuffed, etc. there are too many dishes with rice. Tacos served 3 times last week. Need chicken nuggets."
13332,13332,"More food, less Chinese food, more nuggets, tacos are delish…but nuggets make me smile."
13333,13333,"Better tasting food, more options, and higher quality tasting food."

13340,13340,Stop having breakfast for dinner.
13341,13341,"Cheaper for the type and variety, or more variety for the same price, and no more dry chicken. Why have so much foreign food when less than 10% of population is foreign?"
13342,13342,Cheaper prices.
13343,13343,More choices.
13344,13344,Red vinaigrette salad dressing.

13356,13356,Add orange soda.
13357,13357,"Non-milk products. Myself being lactose intolerant can be a problem when there is a cheese bar, pizza bar, and milk shake bar."
13358,13358,"Stop using that processed egg stuff in the mornings. It gives people loose stools. This isn’t an exaggeration! Also, you have to use a different chicken when you have chicken dishes. It is always dry and tasteless. This is a general consensus amongst all students here."
13359,13359,Better food.
13360,13360,Better selection and quality of foods.
13361,13361,Room food delivery.

13432,13432,Better pizza! Mitzvah ball soup.
13433,13433,"Quality is more important than quantity. I don’t think pizza needs to be served as much. People only eat pizza because the other food is so disgusting. If the other food was good, the money that goes into pizza could be used for other stuff."
13434,13434,Can’t get a sandwich and fries with a meal swipe that sucks.
13435,13435,"I’m 6’4”, 255 pounds, I need more to eat! When I can’t afford a sandwich and fries with one meal wipe, that’s bullshit."

13465,13465,"If it was open late night, I would come and get coffee and dessert."
13466,13466,Open later.
13467,13467,It’s great but go back to 2002 pricing with one entrée and one side and one drink.
13468,13468,"Keep the Verde Campus staff; first time in 15 years we’ve had professional chef/staff, great food and great service."

13473,13473,Open on Saturday.
13474,13474,More seating.
13475,13475,Great job.
13476,13476,"Chairs are uncomfortable, hard and “youth” oriented. The table counter could serve better being square and not round. The coffee is not very good. If the coffee was tastier, it would be wonderful and I would probably tell others about it."
13477,13477,"Mores selection, but overall Janet does an awesome job! I couldn’t be happier."
13478,13478,More attention to the customers.

13482,13482,A cappuccino machine. Janet and Karen are great and are an asset to your company.
13483,13483,More meatless dishes. The only lunch I ever have is grilled cheese. More nutritious vegetable dishes.
13484,13484,More smiling faces behind the lunch counter.
13485,13485,"Only change use cheese in cheese enchiladas instead of cheese sauce! Besides that it’s fine. Ranch dressing for chicken strips, etc."

13519,13519,"Make Papa Joe’s available at the same time for meals as the regular café, make meal times longer, service on the hill like in the past in Zehner (snack bar) would be great."

13547,13547,"I think that having all the condiments out in open containers is unsanitary, and a lot of the vegetarian food has very little taste. I don’t like the times schedules for meals. I wish they were more flexible."
13548,13548,I hope you all are not here next year. Please stop throwing random food together and expecting us to eat it. Poor selection.

13552,13552,Milk is never restocked.
13553,13553,More choices. Fewer mystery meats. The dining room is often too crowded when classes let out. The menu is predictable according to the day of the week.

13573,13573,More meat.
13574,13574,Bring back the points system. Just because there is an extra meal time doesn’t mean you can get an extra meal or a snack. Points are needed again.
13575,13575,The selection is miserable. The place was way too crowded. There wasn’t enough food. And this whole establishment violates anti-trust laws. The times it is open are really inconvenient.
13576,13576,Better variety.
13577,13577,Better food.
13578,13578,"More drink areas, more room, and better food."

13585,13585,"Jane, carol and Christy are all friendly and provide great service. Dinner should be a little cheaper/meal plans. Terry mostly stands around talking to people not doing his job."
13586,13586,"A 15-meal plan, and being able to eat more than 3 meals a day."
13587,13587,We like the grill and the <illegible> at Harms.
13588,13588,"Increase in health conscious food choices, possible diabetic choices (sugar free/Splenda substitute). Diet Big Red uses Splenda sweetener, Maple Groves sugar free syrup. Fat free Miracle Whip at Sandwich bar."
13589,13589,"As long as the quality continues to be as it was this week. These scores are for this week. I really enjoyed the food at every meal. That doesn’t always happen. Oh year, wheat bread, noodles, etc. would be great!"
13590,13590,The food needs to be of higher quality. Especially on night and weekend meals. It seems that on the weekends that Chartwells doesn’t care very much.
13591,13591,Better quality.
13592,13592,"More fruit, eggs and cottage cheese in salad bar, need to add yogurt and granola."

13602,13602,"If you continue to have the good quality of food that you’ve had this week (2-23 thru 2-25) so far, then definitely I’ll be here more often. And if you had whole-wheat products, pasta and breads. That would be good."
13603,13603,More fruit.
13604,13604,"Skim milk! A sandwich bar would be great! For more options. More than one entrée would be +. Pudding for dessert. Spinach at salad bar. Yogurt/granola. Bananas always! Check peas, mushrooms."
13605,13605,"Strippers, beer."
13606,13606,"Skim milk, fat free Italian dressing for salad."
13607,13607,It is very good and we have felt very welcomed here. Thanks.
13608,13608,Hard-boiled eggs every day! The choice in fruit is great. The veggie option is awesome. Thank you! Skim milk? Sub sandwich options?
13609,13609,Use less rosemary; get an Icee or slurpy machine.
13610,13610,Brunch/weekend meals still could be stepped up a notch. Could we get frozen Cokes?
13611,13611,The tomato sauce used on the pizza kind of smells like diesel fuel.
13612,13612,"Have a better selection, especially on the grill, and less salads and stir-fry for main course meal. And Barbara rocks."
13613,13613,"Better soup choices. Nobody likes tomato soup but we like broccoli and cheese, potato soup, chicken noodle, stew. Keep supper open later, because I get hungry at night when dinner is at 5:00 p.m. More chocolate chip and sugar cookies/less of other kinds. Serve fresh fish like you did that one time."
13614,13614,"Better tasting food, (e.g. different pizza sauce, sandwich for dinner, larger cups). Whole milk."
13615,13615,"Why can’t you people get plates, cups, silverware, bowls etc. clean? Dave should cook everything. Move card scanning computer back to entrance door. Too many dropped trays. Also need tray racks by soda fountains. Need to work on many things."
13616,13616,Fresh fruits and veggies.
13617,13617,Good food.
13618,13618,Better food at dinner. Cheaper prices. A lounge singer for dinner.

13621,13621,"The quality of meat (chicken), increase temperature of food, allow dishes to dry before use."

13630,13630,"On time, more flavor, less beef and pork, warm food."

13632,13632,More candy for surveys!
13633,13633,Better food.
13634,13634,More serving areas.

13638,13638,"Wipe off the chairs regularly, they’re always full of crumbs."

13645,13645,Part campus I live on campus.
13646,13646,More hot women.
13647,13647,"If there were serving staff in the lines. Students serving is unsanitary. Serving utensils fall into food, possibly contaminating food and making utensil sticky. I would also like more variability than a weekly cycle."
13648,13648,"Cook rice longer. Cook corn dogs longer. Increase times open on the weekend; feed visitors outside of student lunch time. Have pasta sauce always when offering pasta. Get rid of cops, I am a paying customer, not a criminal."
13649,13649,"More breakfast variety, such as corned beef hash!"
13650,13650,More vegetarian food.
13651,13651,"I would like if the trays moved out to the bar where the soups are put, again it’s annoying when they are in the back."

13658,13658,More choices.
13659,13659,"More food I like, more ice cream flavors."
13660,13660,Move it closer to Baca.
13661,13661,Breakfast: hardboiled eggs and ham.
13662,13662,Have it open during spring break! Twice.
13663,13663,It would be much more convenient if the dining hours for dinner were extended.
13664,13664,Better heat lamps.
13665,13665,"Better food for price paid, less bell pepper, more variety."
13666,13666,Broader variety of foods. Foods that don’t always come out of a can/jar (the ravioli!). Overall though the food is better now than a few years ago.
13667,13667,Continue with what improvements.
13668,13668,"Have more chocolate cake, less rice, and a big smile. Music in the dining hall, dancers at tables. P.s. tell that guy to stop wearing head chef’s outfit."
13669,13669,Fix the TVs.
13670,13670,More variety of food and better quality/price ratio.
13671,13671,Friendlier cashiers.
13672,13672,"“Tami” always harasses me when my friends swipe me in, when my friends aren’t present. Rather than seeing that my friend willingly gave me his card, she made me interrupt his meal and walk over with me. If as much cooking was done as harassing the food would be much better."
13673,13673,"The dinner bar is awesome, keep it and use it more."

13677,13677,I actually could walk to the building in under 10 minutes.
13678,13678,"Better food, more vegetarian food."
13679,13679,"Tell Gimpy to calm down and remind her that without the students, she wouldn’t have a job."

13683,13683,"Decrease the salt content of the chicken, and make sure all beef is cooked properly."
13684,13684,"No cops, trust students to pay, i.e. relax at the doors. Stop restaurant life from stealing our money from you. Chartwells serve us."
13685,13685,"No more over-salty food (better under-salty than over-salty). Cooks must learn to make rice, taste of food must improve; include international dishes, Brazilian Feixuada, Spanish paella (there’s too much Chinese and Italian!); there cannot e one day when only hamburgers and chicken patties are the only food offered (like last Monday). Please that’s unacceptable."
13686,13686,Great.
13687,13687,Survey sucks.
13688,13688,Can’t complain.
13689,13689,No more surveys.
13690,13690,The staff is great! Good job!
13691,13691,"Getting rid of pizzas and going back to sandwiches being made by request. Tuna, chicken salad, and etc. note: Available Green is spectacular and very knowledgeable about food, etc. Julio is also spectacular and very accommodating. We are very fortunate to have them."
13692,13692,Plastic glove wearing while making food. All staff should change gloves when handling money.
13693,13693,"If there was always an option of just a burger or grilled chicken sandwich, if fish or whatever is not your thing."
13694,13694,"Healthy food options, better veggies, sometimes hot dishes are salty."
13695,13695,"Charlie’s open later. Healthier alternatives, i.e. Eggbeaters in café. And Pam spray not butter. Qx 19. Don’t eat here enough."
13696,13696,Variety.
13697,13697,Not a thing.
13698,13698,Rock on Dude!
13699,13699,Add breakfast sandwiches. Charlie’s is not nearly as good as Porter dining facility. Much more selection there. Very limited here.
13700,13700,Nothing but more people that understand English.
13701,13701,More variety for vegetarian and more variety of food.
13702,13702,"Julio is very friendly, definitely an asset to your organization."
13703,13703,Love the ABP soups!
13704,13704,Some different food options. The same stuff every week gets old. Also some of the staff needs to have an attitude adjustment and treat all students the same. Cut down on grease and oil used to fix our meals.
13705,13705,More variety. A nicer staff. Some of them are very rude and sometimes unfair. They should have more options for diabetics.
13706,13706,I am happy with simplicity.
13707,13707,"You don’t listen to the students. The only thing we can eat is what Patty cooks. The Club House was good until you moved her too. We pay a lot of money to eat here everything is always fried/battered, buttered. Do you want us to die with a heart attack! You also need to talk to some of the servers. We are not small children, and don’t need to be treated like we are. Do you realize I have Crohn’s disease and there is rarely anything that fits my dieting guidelines. Some serious changes need to be made. We see bugs all the time, dishes are dirty, and the meat on the bar is always warm. Some of the employees of Chartwells are a delight to be around. The few that are not stick out and we notice. If you had the choice to either use the $6.00 a meal and eat here or go elsewhere would you spend your money here, I doubt it. Prisoners at Mt. Olive have better food than this. The Club House is filthy too."
13708,13708,"Better food for what we pay. The TV music sucks. Show more rock. Qx 18. Enemy, maybe. Qx 19. Unlikely as hell. Qx 20. Not clean, not good food. Get Pepsi."
13709,13709,"I wish they had skim milk. Sometimes during breakfast, there will be no milk. The “food your way” bar is great."
13710,13710,"More food variety, better tasting food, longer operating times that accommodate students and especially athlete schedules."
13711,13711,"Different food choices, too much good stuff at once. And a lot of bad stuff at once. Spread it out."
13712,13712,Times of service.
13713,13713,More choices of foods. There have been many of dinners I have had to resort to cereal and I am not a picky eater.
13714,13714,"Make sure breakfast products are available. Several times there has been no milk, cereal, cups. No water? Qx 18. Because that’s the only choice."
13715,13715,"Get better food, and stop using the same grease ALL the time."
13716,13716,Better hours with some flexibility. A lot better food selection and quality.
13717,13717,"More variety in food, more cups, keep milk fresh, faster food your way."
13718,13718,"Serve Pepsi products. Also, breakfast is too greasy. It upsets my stomach."
13719,13719,"Food is horrible, and you need to quit this business."
13720,13720,Make the Bear’s Den open longer.
13721,13721,"More variety, better kinds of meats."
13722,13722,Get real food.
13723,13723,Better weekend hours.
13724,13724,The cost under five dollars and longer period to eat in the dining hall would increase my likelihood to eat there.
13725,13725,Abby is the best!
13726,13726,Moroccan food. More ethnic foods.
13727,13727,A few more choices would be good.
13728,13728,More choice.
13729,13729,Variety.
13730,13730,"Better quality meat, cheaper prices. Packages, meal deals."
13731,13731,Lower prices.
13732,13732,More vegan options please.
13733,13733,Lower some of the prices for food.
13734,13734,"Prices are high, they should be lowered."
13735,13735,"Better quality food. The staff and service is great, but I don’t usually like the food unless it is a U-day! Abby is serving Moroccan food, more of that please!"
13736,13736,Supper staff needs to be better dressed and more professional. Cafeteria should change weekday and Saturday supper times. (5:00-7:00 M-F. 5-6:30 Sat.)
13737,13737,Clean the fruits.
13738,13738,"Use less grease and unnecessary butter, ex. Noodles, potatoes slathered in butter, and carrots."

Many people go home and come back late, however they are unable to eat since it is closed. Also, while I understand many students work in Muse under work-study, I feel that they should be polite even if they don't like the job. I have had several instances with employees who have been just plain rude. In one instance the server has walked away form the counter while I was in line. When she returned she seemed as if I was bothering her and infringing upon her social time. This is totally inappropriate behavior for someone who works with the public."

15016,15016,I like Muse “Traditions” with food like carved roast turkey or ham and yogurt machine.

15025,15025,Mixing up the variety a little more.
15026,15026,All burgers should be cooked fresh off the grill to each bun instead of being placed in water. Servers need to use “hold” timers on French fries so we don’t get soft soggy fires.

15055,15055,"More selection, Rice Krispies treats!"

15072,15072,"Real orange juice, not that orange drink. Fresh desserts in the refrigerated section, not stale Coke. Textured trays so everything doesn’t slide all over them. Less distance to reach your food in line. A tray’s distance plus the two-foot gap makes reaching your food difficult."
15073,15073,Allow us to use the plastic ware if we feel uncomfortable using the silverware.
15074,15074,Not sure.

15106,15106,"More fruits and vegetables single ones not casseroles, more variety of them."
15107,15107,More fruits and veggies – not casseroles.

15121,15121,Roll-over for meal plan. Decrease some food prices (e.g.$1.00 for milk)!
15122,15122,"Bananas would be great! I love the staff and cleanliness, etc but the food isn't always so tasty. It's hard to cook in mass quantities - maybe more low fat options (besides just one salad dressing) would be nice."
15123,15123,Different selections of foods/pastas/dishes with meat in them. The staff is wonderful.

15339,15339,Better tasting food.
15340,15340,Threat of maiming or other bodily harm if we don't. Importing Chic-Fil-A and Applebee's. Definitely Applebee's. Knives that aren't duller than spoons would help. Don't mix shredded meat and pasta. It doesn't work. Trust me.  No plastic in hamburger or ice cream. The ice cream is the best thing you've got going. More chocolate ice cream too. And more hot cookie nights. 100% of students polled prefer crinkle fries over normal fries. I like cheese. Do you like cheese? Cheese is a good thing. You generally don't get it quite right.
15341,15341,Please try not to salt the food for us. It would be appreciated. Example: tuna salad.

15349,15349,"Often on weekends I miss breakfast because I have to leave before 10:45. Even if a hot breakfast wasn't offered, it would be nice to eat off the dry/waffle bar."
15350,15350,"#1 increase quality of food. You almost never offer fresh burgers. Instead, you grill them and then dump them into lukewarm water. This is disgusting, and also cannot be very healthy. Why don't you just serve us fresh grilled burgers!? Your vegetables are drowning in grease! The grease makes the vegetables inedible, and really messes up one's body. Don’t put grease on the veggies! Instead, put out a bowl of butter for people who want that, and leave the veggies plain for those of us who don't want the grease! Fewer onions! I once picked out the equivalent of an entire onion out of one plate of food. A little onion is okay, but too much is too much! Also, why do you put onion in with all the salad greens? It makes the greens taste bad! Put out a separate bowl of onions for those who want. <Comment continues>"
15351,15351,"<Comment continued> Bring back the mixed salad greens like we had at the end of last semester. I have time and again asked for those mixed greens, but to no avail. Why not? Are they too healthy for Chartwells standards? Stop running out of supplies! You are always running out of bacon. We are not served it often, and it is a nice treat, but you are always running out. I have (politely) pointed this out to the manager, but things never change. Do you really think 10 pounds of bacon will feed 1000 students?"
15352,15352,"Overall you do a very good job. However, I'd like to see better entrée dishes served. They usually seem kind of hodge podge."

Egg rolls are also yummy, calzones are very yummy. More! For those of us with meal plans that don't allow us to eat every meal (because we don't want to eat that many meals). PLEASE have ACCURATE menus for the week up PROMPTLY. It allows us to pick and choose which meals to eat in the cafeteria based on what we like to eat. Menus in the dorms are also nice."

There is quite a mix of variety in the cafeteria, but some people won't see it if they eat there only certain days and times and you serve the same stuff at those times. Campus Store needs more variety in food options. Sandellas is excellent, but why do only certain foods count for transfer meals?

15489,15489,"Not happy with Sandellas! The hours of Sandellas on weekends are very poor; transfer meals should be usable at all hours - need fast meals between classes. There need to be fries, hamburgers, etc."
