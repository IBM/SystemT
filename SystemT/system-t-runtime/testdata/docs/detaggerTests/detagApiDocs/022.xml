I booked a room online with wheretosleep.com 
at the Silton Hotel and they never got the reservation. 
We need a King bed and then they didn't have one
when we checked in. When I called 
wheretosleep.com back they said they had a guaranteed King room and paid
for it. We had to go to another hotel that could accomodate us.
Since they promised WhereToSleep.com a King room for us, we should not have
to pay them.
