We booked the EverOdd Motel with wheretosleep.com and paid in full. 
Then at check out the hotel said we owed more!
We called wheretosleep.com customer service and they said our hotel
was paid in full and we should not have been charged by the hotel.
The hotel said they weren't covering the taxes and fees in their corporate
rate. We should not have to pay the hotel any extra since we paid in full on
WhereToSleep.com
