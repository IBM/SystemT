<text>
wheretosleep.com double-billed me: once by their site and once by the Galdat Suites 
hotel. It took 
10 calls to reach someone - I had to keep calling back. "We are working on 
this sir, please call back in 24 hours". Again and again. They had no way to 
call me back or to escalate the call. I had to keep calling their kind but 
helpless entry-level customer service reps.
