I recently used wheretosleep.com for the first time to book a
room online at the Sherlock hotel 
for a business trip to Milwaukee. Upon arriving at the hotel, 
they had no record of my reservation, and I was forced to
pay the hotel.   The wheretosleep.com customer service told me that 
they did pay the Sherlock hotel. I believe that 
the hotel lost the reservation in their system but did get paid by wheretosleep.com.
