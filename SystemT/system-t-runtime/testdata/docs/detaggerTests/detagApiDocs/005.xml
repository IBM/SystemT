We paid for our reservation when we made it using WhereToSleep.com, but 
then we gave a different 
credit card when we got to the Easy Street Lodge and checked in.
We finally realized that 
we got charged twice for the stay!  Both 
credit card accounts had the same charge - on one from WhereToSleep.com on 
then on the other one by the
hotel from when we checked out.  We can't get our money back from either.
The hotel says they didn't get payment from the online site, and 
we can't resolve this with WhereToSleep.com with multiple 
telephone calls to their customer service.  Maybe you can??
