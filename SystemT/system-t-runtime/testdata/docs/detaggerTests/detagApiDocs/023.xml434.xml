We are having a problem getting a refund.  We got double charged for a 
stay at the Silencer hotel.  One of the payments was online to
WhereToSleep.com. The hotel's customer support 
told me they would look into it. I called them again after 30 days 
after I got my statement and they said the same thing. 
They are negotiating something with WhereToSleep.com but not resolving it.
