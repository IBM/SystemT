I booked a room online with wheretosleep.com 
at the Galdat Suites
and they really messed up on my reservation. I asked for a room for 
3 adults, my husband, myself and my daughter. They said the King room 
had a pull out sofabed. I booked it and when I received my confirmation, 
it said 2 adults and no room designation. I called the Galdat Suites hotel directly 
and they said their King rooms do not have sofa beds. When I called 
wheretosleep.com back they said they couldn't guarantee a King room anyway. 
I was forced to find another hotel that could accomodate all of us.
I was unable to get wheretosleep.com to refund the money since they had
already paid it to the hotel.
WhereToSleep.com promised we would get this room and the hotel
could not deliver, so we should
not have to pay them.
