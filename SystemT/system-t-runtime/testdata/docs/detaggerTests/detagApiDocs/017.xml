We made an online reservation for the Desperado Inn over the phone after 6 pm, 
got to the room and found out it did not have two beds as promised and it 
was nonsmoking and we wanted a smoking room. The site WhereToSleep.com 
don't think they should give us our money back because we canceled as soon 
as we noticed the room did not have the features as promised
and the hotel did not have a room that did.
