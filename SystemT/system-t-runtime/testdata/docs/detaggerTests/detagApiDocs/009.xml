I booked a non-refundable stay online with wheretosleep.com 
at the Sherlock Hotel for 3 rooms, 2 nights. The child of one 
of our party was put in the ICU of the hospital with a serious 
medical condition. When I called to cancel the reservation, I was told 
I could either provide a letter from the doctor to cancel the rooms or I 
could modify the date, but could not cancel or else I would still have to 
pay. We opted to change our stay to a later date. I tried to no avail online. I began 
calling yesterday (Monday) because the current reservations are for 
Friday. I have been getting the runaround and an unable to resolve this 
for 2 days. I called them 8 
times today, and have spent the last 2 1/2 hours on the telephone. I was 
either told by wheretosleep.com to call back (after 30 minutes of being put 
on hold so they can get it approved by the hotel mgr) or someone 
dialed two numbers so I would get a message stating they could not 
continue processing my call (3 times). I called the hotel, and they 
said I had to go through wheretosleep.com....bottom line: I have $900+ on 
a credit card that I may not get back. Hotel is not sympathetic 
because it is their rules. wheretosleep.com has no compassion. Poor customer 
service.
