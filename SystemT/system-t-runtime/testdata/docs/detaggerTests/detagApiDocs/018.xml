We paid for this reservation when we made it
 using WhereToSleep.com, but then we used a different 
credit card when we checked in to the Inikii Inn. 
The charge is on both of our statements, 
so we realized that we had been charged 
twice for the stay, once by WhereToSleep.com on one card and then from the
hotel at check out.  Neither one will give us our money back. 
The hotel can't find where they 
received payment from the online site but we paid them and so did the site.
