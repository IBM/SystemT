We had paid for our reservation using WhereToSleep.com, but used a different 
credit card when checking in to the Bedbug Inn hotel. 
After we received our statements, we realized that we had been charged 
twice for the stay, once by wheretosleep.com on one card and once by the
hotel when we checked out and we are not getting our money back. 
The hotel claims they never received payment from the online site, and 
we have been unable to resolve this with WhereToSleep.com despite multiple 
telephone calls to their customer service.
