I was double-billed when I used WhereToSleep.com 
I paid them and then I had to also pay Galdat Suites 
hotel. It took me many calls to their customer service to reach
anyone - I had to keep calling back. They'd say "We are working on 
this sir, please call back in 24 hours". 
Over and over!  I don't know why, but they would not ever 
call me back or let escalate to a supervisor. I shouldn't have had
to pay the hotel, but they insist I resolve it with WhereToSleep.com.
If the hotel just refunded my money, I'd be happy.
