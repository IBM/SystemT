<text>
We made a prepaid reservation for a hotel using WhereToSleep.com. 
We got there and they told us our booking had got cancelled. 
Fortunately they had a room but it was a higher rate.
I just want to refund from WhereToSleep.com.  If it was cancelled, they 
should refund it.
I made several telephone calls to them but I can't get through to anyone.
