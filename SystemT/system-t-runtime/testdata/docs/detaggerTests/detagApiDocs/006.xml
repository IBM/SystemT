We reserved a room online at the Madishroom hotel over the phone 
late in the day for a specific room with a balcony.
We got there and saw that it was not what we wanted - no balcony.
Then we called WhereToSleep.com customer service and they
would not let us cancel, even tho we did not stay there and 
even only had the reservation for a couple of hours. 
The room did not have the features as promised
and the hotel did not have a room that did. WhereToSleep.com 
thinks they should keep our money because we canceled after 6 pm, but we didn't 
even make the reservation until after that!  We did not use the room,
and they did not provide the service they promised so we should not
have to pay this charge.
