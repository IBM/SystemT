I booked a room online for the Maple Suites
and WhereToSleep.com got it all wrong.  We were supposed to get 
a room with 2 queen beds, for myself, my husband, and our two kids
They said the King suite had a queen sized sofabed - that was OK.
I booked it and when I we got there we had only one king bed!
I called WhereToSleep.com directly 
and they said the King suite with sofabed had been 
guaranteed by the hotel. I had to book another room for two more people.
Since they promised something they could not deliver, we should
not have to pay them.
