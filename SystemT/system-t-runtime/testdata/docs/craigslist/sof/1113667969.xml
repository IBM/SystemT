    <description><![CDATA[Gracenote is seeking a full-time Senior Database Engineer to join Gracenote's Database and Content Applications Team, working on Gracenotes Mobile Systems and Mobile MusicID product (<a href="http://www.gracenote.com/business_solutions/mobileMusic/"  rel="nofollow">http://www.gracenote.com/business_solutions/mobileMusic/</a>).
<br>

<br>
As a senior member of the Database and Content Applications Team you will have the opportunity to continue the development and enhancement of Gracenote's world famous CDDB music recognition service, fingerprint matching services, and other leading technologies. These technologies help power industry leading applications such as Apple iTunes, RealOne, Winamp, Sony Sonic Stage, and many more. Gracenote Mobile services are being delivered in applications throughout the world, including Brazil, Japan, Korea, and the USA.
<br>

<br>
On a day-to-day basis, you will design and implement significant portions of code, leveraging your work across more than one product  you will be a key individual contributor in the company.  Furthermore, you will often be the go-to person for difficult assignments and solving issues that arise during crunch-time.  You must be highly self-motivated, creative, and able to deal effectively and successfully with multiple projects at the same time.
<br>

<br>
From a technical perspective, you will have total command of relational database technologies and server-side development and be able to build world-class database applications rapidly.  Few, if any technical issues will prevent you from moving forward aggressively.  If you encounter a difficult problem youll work quickly to resolve it: youll know where to go to get help  either by independent research or by working with your teammates.  You will insist on the highest quality in your own work and that of others.  As a lead developer on new projects, you will be expected to create, maintain, and own technical specifications, designs, and schedules with little direction from your manager.  Finally, because part of your job will require working with an established system, you must be able to get up-to-speed quickly by reading code, reviewing production processes, and developing test and use cases of your own.
<br>

<br>
The successful candidate must have excellent technical skills, excellent communication skills, excellent attention to detail and follow-up, the ability to self-manage, the ability to dive into existing systems, read code and learn proactively, plus a desire to work in the exciting field of digital music technology.
<br>

<br>
