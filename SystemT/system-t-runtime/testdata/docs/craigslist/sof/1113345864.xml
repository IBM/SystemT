<p>Genomic Health Inc. (GHI) is seeking a computer system validation engineer who has experience with the implementation of applications as well as software validation. GHI takes appropriate steps to ensure that all third-party software functions reliably to meet user requirements. The nature of those steps and the amount of effort is right-sized based on the nature of the system, potential risks associated with failure, technical complexity, and regulatory requirements for validation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The contractor will guide members of implementation teams in determining appropriate QA activities using a "critical thinking approach." We seek to identify the most meaningful set of confidence-building QA activities to apply during the implementation. Critical thinking results in a QA approach that ensures that the software is safe for use and an appropriate level of documented evidence. As a result, individuals performing the work and the end users feel that the effort was least burdensome and value-added.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Computer Systems Validation Engineer will work under the direction of Regulatory / Quality Assurance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This will be a 6-9mo contract.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>Play a key role in determining what quality assurance activities are appropriate to the software being implemented</li>
<li>Coordinate with project management, RA/ QA, IT, and user groups as needed to plan for and ensure the completion of the QA activities</li>
<li>Provide informal training and support to the users on tasks such as: the documentation of requirements, the creation of tests, the capture of appropriate objective evidence of test results, and the handling of system failures. For some projects, the contractor will perform these activities him/herself.</li>
<li>Ensure that appropriate documentation is created and preserved</li>
<li>In-depth experience in software / computer system validations and flexibility in the use of validation methods and techniques is a must. </li>
<li>Proven experience as a member of teams that implemented computer systems for which validation is not required.</li>
<li>Strong knowledge of validation regulations, guidance documents, industry standards, methods, and Part 11. Understanding of what is meant by taking a risk-based approach and experience with such approaches.</li>
<li>Ability to lead and provide support to others in collaborative efforts to create QA deliverables</li>
<li>Demonstrated ability to influence project teams and individuals on computer validation matters.</li>
<li>Excellent problem solving and analytical skills.</li>
<li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills.</li>
<li>Ability to work independently, follow company policies, procedures, and methods; motivated self-starter; well organized and reliable.</li>
<li>Ability to work as a team member. </li>
<li>Commitment to quality; detail and results oriented.</li>
<li>Broad knowledge of quality system regulations, such as CLIA, QSRs, GCPs, ISO 13485, ISO 14971, and the Global Harmonization Task Force guidance. Experience with quality assurance in regulated industries is a plus. </li>
<li>Knowledge of the SOX regulations and their implications for software implementation is a plus.</li>
