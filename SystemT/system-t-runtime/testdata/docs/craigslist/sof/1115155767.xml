    <description><![CDATA[Description:  Salesforce.com is the enterprise cloud computing company. Our portfolio of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, including our award-winning customer relationship management (CRM), has revolutionized the ways that customers manage and share business information over the Internet. Salesforce.com has evolved from a startup founded by four people in a cramped San Francisco apartment ten years ago to a company described by Barrons as the fastest growing business software company in the world. With more than 3,000 employees, over $1B in annual revenues, and over a million users worldwide, we are proud to contribute to the success of companies of all sizes, in all industries, around the globe. According to Gartner, 25% of all software will be deployed via the cloud computing model by 2011. No matter how you slice it, the future of software is cloud computing. Consider joining the cloud computing leader, Salesforce.com, and be part of the team that is creating this future.

<br>

<br>

How about working on a system that performs over 180 million transactions per day? If your answer is yes to any of these questions, this is your opportunity to join a dynamic Technology team at salesforce.com, the market leader in cloud computing.

<br>

<br>
QA engineers will be working with other experienced QA engineers to design, create, document, implement and maintain test scripts for complex on-demand functionality. You should be self directed, team oriented, and actually know and care what the customer wants from our service. This position requires healthy doses of initiative and flexibility in a very dynamic environment. You should like to break things, be exhilarated when you discover that really complicated bug, and be detail-oriented enough that you've actually had people comment on it. You also have to be comfortable with initial manual testing of new features, so you have the understanding to correctly architect and implement the automation afterwards. You've got to have strong background in Object-Oriented programming concepts and constructs. You will need to identify missing test cases and refine existing scripts for modularity and automation purposes, estimate and prioritize work for optimal risk mitigation and identify suitable regression suites.
<br>

<br>
Responsibilities:
<br>

<br>
    * At least 2+ years experience in SQA, both black and white box
<br>
    * Good programming skills in Java or C++
<br>
    * 1+ years experience with an automation scripting language, preferably Selenium. This is less critical if you have solid programming experience in at least one language
<br>
    * Excellent written and verbal communication skills, as exemplified by clear bug/issue explanations, documentation of knowledge, and effective intra- and inter-group communications
<br>
    * Experience in short release cycles, the full software lifecycle, and have worked on a product that was actually released for public consumption
<br>
    * Bachelor's Degree. A BS in CS or EE preferred.
<br>

<br>
Required Skills/Experience:
<br>

<br>
    * Strong knowledge of Database interface and SQL
<br>
    * Experience with shell/perl scripting
<br>
    * Experience in multi-platform testing (Windows, UNIX, LINUX)

    * Experience with load testing tools such as Silkperformer or LoadRunner
<br>
    * Solid knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, Java and XML/SOAP
<br>
