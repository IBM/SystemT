    <description><![CDATA[Overview
<br>
We are a startup developing an online platform for the delivery of highly personalized real-time news and information.   News, including magazines and technical journals, should be provided by people to people.  Experts should emerge independently of business interests and self-appointed editorial boards.  News is undergoing a deep industry-wide transformation.  Now there is a window of opportunity to redefine the way it is found and transmitted.  We are building a new internet-based ecosystem that will make this possible for millions of users interacting in real time.  We are seeking talented developers who believe in this mission.
