    <description><![CDATA[Qumu (koo-moo) provides enterprise software solutions to enable organizations to easily capture, manage, publish and distribute live and on-demand video content while leveraging existing IT infrastructure.  Large organizations today are increasingly using video to communicate, teach, market and to be more competitive. Companies are spending a tremendous amount of time and money on expensive production equipment with the goal of providing high quality, reliable video presentations that scale to large international audiences. However, these efforts and investments often do not meet ROI goals because there is no underlying system to manage the events, content and resources to simplify the production and to reliably search, access, secure and distribute over the companys existing infrastructure. To meet these needs, Qumus software solutions provide video network and asset management, and media access services that deliver the following benefits: 
<br>

<br>
 Manage thousands of video assets and easily categorize and store them for search and use in video programs
<br>
 Scale live video streams and video-on-demand to an enterprise audience across global corporate networks 
<br>
 Centrally manage and dynamically publish to any number of third party portals or web properties for audience viewing 
<br>
