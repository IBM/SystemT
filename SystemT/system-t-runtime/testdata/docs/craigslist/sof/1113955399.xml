    <description><![CDATA[The economy is tough, so why not try something adventurous this year?
<br>

<br>
QuickSchools.com is a SaaS startup which is inviting software engineers from silicon valley to come work with us in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Yup, you don't see this kind of opportunity every day!
<br>

<br>
Here's the deal.
<br>

<br>
QuickSchools.com is based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We've just raised venture funding in order to aggressively market our SaaS online school administration software in the United States. Think about it:
<br>
* There are over 30,000 private schools in the US. And many times more public schools.
<br>
* Schools are now rapidly adopting software solutions to increase their productivity.
<br>
* The existing software on the market is old. Most of them are still delivered the old-fashioned way - installing on on-site servers. They are nowhere near the cutting edge of what's happening with Web2.0, SaaS, social media, and so on.
<br>
* Schools REALLY want to save money for education, so providing an affordable SaaS solution MAKES SENSE.
<br>

<br>
We believe QuickSchools.com is well-positioned to hit this market hard. BUT we've got a problem: We need talented J2EE software engineers to work in Malaysia who know what it's like to work in a Silicon Valley environment. If you think this sounds like an adventure too good to refuse, read on.
<br>

<br>
First of all, straight up: We won't be able to offer you compensation that matches your US-based compensation. However, we CAN offer a salary that allows you to live a VERY comfortable life here in Malaysia (between RM 10,000 and RM 12,000 per month). We believe Malaysia is a wonderful place to live in. The expatriates who work in Malaysia certainly enjoy their life here very much. (There are some who choose to stay here forever... but that's another story!) Plus so many exotic destinations are a close 2+ hour flight away: Singapore, Bangkok, Philippines, Phuket islands, Vietnam, Cambodia, and so on.
<br>

<br>
And relocation... well, about all we can take care of is your flight out here. But hey, this is an adventure, so just pack your bags and come on over.
<br>

<br>
Please check out www.quickschools.com for an idea of what we do. There's quite a bit more work to do... and we need your help to get there.
<br>

<br>
There are a variety of senior-level positions we're offering: Lead Architect, R&D Manager, Senior Software Engineer.
<br>

<br>
Sounds good?  Please email your resume and tell us why you'd like to take up this opportunity: adventure at quickschools dot com
<br>

<br>
p.s. If your background or interest is different from the above, but the idea of working at QuickSchools.com is appealing and you believe you have something solid to offer, let us know!
<br>
p.p.s. We also have a sales position in the US. If you have anyone you'd like to recommend, we'd love to hear.]]></description>
