    <description><![CDATA[<p>Are you interested in working on delivering entertainment over the Internet, at one of the leading players in the field? Instant streaming is a core part of Netflixs strategy for the future. While we believe that disc-based media will have a long life, Netflix is committed to aggressively growing Internet delivery of movies in ways that are convenient, compelling, and cost effective for our members. The first step in this evolution was in January 2007, when we first gave our members a way to watch movies instantly on computers. We now want to bring this instant watching experience directly to our members TVs. The first product to support instant streaming to TVs, the Netflix Player by Roku, was launched in May 2008. For details, see www.netflix.com/NetflixReadyDevices and www.roku.com/netflixplayer/ . Our other partnerships with LG and Xbox will be ready to stream movies to the TV later this year, with more partnership announcements coming soon. 

<p>About the role: 

<p>This project is a key part of Netflixs strategic effort to enable our members to view movies they love instantly on their TV. In order to help partner companies add the Netflix instant streaming service quickly to their device, we provide a client platform that implements a user interface, movie playback, streaming and authentication. This platform is currently used for devices from Roku, Microsoft (Xbox) and LG, with many more to be announced. As part of a very small team of experienced engineers, you will be working on that platform, in order to make it ever more useful to our partners: to implement new, more sophisticated algorithms for e.g. streaming and playback, diverse UI implementations, as well as to evolve it for new types of devices. You will need to be innovative and able to apply your technical leadership in order to make a significant impact on Netflix. 

<p>Required skills and attributes: 

<p><li>You love building great software using modern development practices! 
<li>You know what's important when releasing software to partners - ideally, you have been both at the producing as well the consuming end of an SDK. 
<li>Youre comfortable with proactive outward communication and technical leadership. 
<li>You are an expert C++ programmer. 
<li>You are experienced in designing and building multithreaded logic. 
<li>You know how to make code portable to multiple platforms. 
<li>Ideally, you have a background in one or more of: Linux system-level programming, TCP/IP networking, audio/video playback, software security and UI programming. 
<li>5+ years of relevant experience
