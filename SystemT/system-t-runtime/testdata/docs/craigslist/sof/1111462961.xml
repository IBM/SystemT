    <description><![CDATA[The Education Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY) at Stanford University is a continuing project dedicated to developing and offering multimedia computer-based courses.  EPGY provides K-8 students of all abilities with an opportunity to accelerate their education through highly individualized instruction in mathematics and writing.  EPGY also provides accelerated courses for gifted K-12 students at levels ranging from Kindergarten through advanced undergraduate.  EPGY offers these courses both through schools to students working on site and directly to individual students as part of a distance learning program.  We are an energetic group of people who are committed to improving the quality of education and making a difference in the lives of students.

<br>

<br>
Provide programming support for EPGY.  Working closely with other senior programming staff, the Senior Course Development Programmer will provide programming support for EPGYÂ’s educational efforts.  This work will focus on development of courses in mathematics that require automated theorem proving systems and in language arts that require the use of parsing of formal and natural languages.  The Senior Course Development Programmer will also assist curriculum authors and project managers, and will oversee other staff in the writing of programs.
<br>

<br>
The Senior Course Development Programmer must exercise a great deal of independence in working on complex technical issues that few others in the EPGY group will be able to understand fully.  He/she will make difficult decisions about the detailed course of the development and will be one of the few people who will be able to understand the development well enough to make fixes in an economical manner.
<br>

<br>
Qualifications:
<br>

<br>
Masters degree in computer science or mathematics, or some other technical subject, is preferred, as well as a proven track record of working on complex programming projects especially in the areas of automated proof checking/theorem proving and/or parsing and processing of formal and natural languages.  Knowledge of Java and the fundamentals of web programming is required.  An understanding of XML and client/server communications is required.  Familiarity with instruction in advanced mathematics is desired, and also experience with the writing and use of formal grammars to parse restricted natural corpuses of natural language, even some experience in semantic models for natural language.
