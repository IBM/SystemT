    <description><![CDATA[Profitable and Expanding! Two words that describe our client in the growing Cloud Infrastructure Services Space. In business since 2001, our client started out by providing dedicated hosting services for businesses of all sizes, and for the past year-and-a-half they have been expanding their Cloud-based services. They provide 24x7x365 support & reliability.  Their services allow clients to rapidly create, deploy, balance & scale Windows & Linux cloud servers in minutes with a user-friendly UI.<br><br>

My client is seeking a hands-on & technical Software Development Manager/Director for this 110 person (and growing) company. This person will be responsible for a team of 30 software engineers, both locally and off-shore, and you will lead them in Software Development & Build/Release. You will define and lead high level implementations in an Agile Environment, including Process, Tools and Resources.  This position is NOT a pure management position; this person is expected to contribute technically to their projects.<br><br>

Exceptional benefits, VERY competitive compensation, great location (just a block from BART) - and a progressive, enjoyable culture.  Relocation options are available as well, so candidates outside the Bay Area are encouraged to inquire!<br><br>

Our ideal candidate will be VERY strong in Java/J2EE, highly comfortable and experienced in working in an Agile environment, will have significant SaaS experience, five or more years of managing/directing, have participated in code review, and MUST be comfortable with leading by example.  This will definitely be a hands-on position.  Cloud/Virtualization experience will be a massive benefit.<br><br>

If you feel you satisfy these requirements, please inquire!  I do have a number of other available positions available throughout the Bay in Software Development/Management/Etc - please feel free to get in touch should this position not be a fit for you.  Thanks!
