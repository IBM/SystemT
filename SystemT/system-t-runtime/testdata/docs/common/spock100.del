  About Us - Graham  

            BIOS  

              BACK  

              Graham R. Jones - Historian-At-Large  
              Raised in London and South East England in the post 
              war years, my early cycling experiences were dominated by club rides 
              and time-trials. Like so many of my generation we wanted to break 
              out of the TT world and ride road races like the European pro's. 
              Having cut my teeth on British road races and tasted Belgian racing 
              on a few brief vacations, I decided to terminate my fledgling engineering 
              career and headed for Belgium. My parents were totally disgusted! 

              I spent 1967 and 1968 based in Ghent and racing over 
              much of Europe. By 1972 I had raced myself empty and turned my attention 
              to building a serious career.   

              I stopped riding completely and eventually moved to 
              Germany in 1975. I stayed there working for Hewlett-Packard (HP) 
              until they transferred me to our current base near Boston in 1988. 
              Having retired from HP, I now run my own sales/ marketing consulting 
              business.   
              After moving to the U.S. my wife regularly teased 
              me in front of friends that ""he claims to have raced bicycles"". 
              So around 1990 I dusted off my 1970 Bill Hurlow and had a rude awakening 
              with my first attempts to ride. However, shortly thereafter I 'found' 
              New England's premier cycling club, the   CCB 
              International  , which turned out to be Tyler Hamilton's 
              home club. I train and race (almost) like the old days with the 
              CCB and now form part of their Super-G team (G standing for geriatric!). 

              I have a beautiful wife and two wonderful teenage 
              daughters. Through my writing I try to express my passion for the 
              sport which I hope encourages others to take a keener interest in 
              it's many facets.

At VAL, he served as CEO or COO of several portfolio companies. Earlier in his career, he was an IT Industry Generalist, focused on telecommunications technology, at the Gartner Group, where he was also Executive Assistant to the CEO, Gideon Gartner. He began his career in 1983 in Austin, Texas at Business Development Partners, an early-stage venture capital partnership. Biddle is an alumnus of the University of Virginia.  
        Biddle currently serves on the boards of Trusted Edge, Vision Chain, CorasWorks, Netcordia, Triumfant and Fiberzone Networks. Past board or observer seats include SafeView, Inc. (acquired by L3 Communications), Matrics (acquired by Symbol Technologies), Giga Information Group (Nasdaq: GIGX., acquired by Forrester), Telogy Networks (acquired by Texas Instruments), Tantivy (acquired by Interdigital), AnswerLogic (acquired by Primus Knowledge Systems), and Blackboard, Inc.

	  Pont du Gard   
	  A visit to the Roman aqueduct should be on everyone's list  

	The Pont du Gard is a stunning piece of first century engineering, an architectural marvel, a slice of live history and a great day out for visiters to the region wrapped up in one.  It qualified for special UNESCO World Heritage status in 1985 as a monument because it is a masterpiece of human creative genius, bears an exceptional testimony to a civilisation which has disappeared and is an example of a type of building which illustrates a signirficant stage in human history.  

  the Pont du Gard  

  Things to do at the Pont du Gard  

Since 1996 the Pont du Gard was placed under a management regime and as a result it has a number of well developed facilities for its 1,250,000 tourists a year.   

The Pont du Gard has an interactive children�s museum, which will keep inquiring minds and little hands busy for a good hour. The imaginative displays show different features of everyday life of Roman Gaullist France from a child�s perspective, and parents can relax because none of the exhibits are breakable!   

Downstairs the Pont du Gard has a museum for adults, which is something of a cathedral to the Pont du Gard in size and grandeur. It explains in English, German and French how the Pont du Gard was built, why it was built and re-enacts the event with multi media interactive models.  

Upstairs, one can browse in various tourist shops if that�s what one wants to do, for post cards and souvenirs of Provence, or take a coffee outside in the shade of one of the tables set out there. Or alternatively, in the summer there is usually an ice cream seller there who will furnish you with at least 20 delicious exotic flavours. Only approved vendors are allowed to ply a trade in this spot.  

The centre offers an open walk entitled �Memories of the Garrigues�, which is a chance to see something of the story of the countryside through the ages, as it has been cleared in Roman times, planted, and cultivated. The Garrigue is the dry wild landscape which survives on the hills and valleys around the hot Mediterrean basin. Its rugged and tenacious plants cling to rocks and survive the summer heat, and marking out the region from the more gentle arable countryside further northwards and inland. The walk offers information plaques and is relaxing and also educational for children.  

The Pont du Gard normally strides the Gardon River   

  canoeing on the Gardon River  
  river with its three arch levels, but in the summer its more of a skip than a stride, as the water levels fall away in the drought, and canoes make their way past bathers paddling in knee high water.   

On a fine sunny day, which is most days from May onwards, the piercing blue sky is cut by the huge roman archways as one walks under them. It is possible to clamber up the sides of the hill past scrawny olive trees and wiry bushes to get a better view. One can see the tunnel where the water was conveyed along the top up close, but climbing on the monument is completely �interdit!�.  Unless you visit the museum you will not realise that there are other remnants of the aqueduct that can be visited by walking through the hills or at various villages in the area.  Ask for information at the desk.  The starting point of the water supply can also be seen at Uz�s, the end point in Nimes.  

Alongside the Pont du Gard one has the opportunity to swim, picnic, or take another coffee/beer in the beautiful and elegant 18th century building that is now a caf�, sheltered under huge Plane trees.  

Canoeing is on offer near the banks of the Gardon, and I cannot think of a more fitting way to see the Pont du Gard than from under its monumental arches in a canoe. In the summer, the Gardon river is shallow under the Pont du Gard and its very safe for children to paddle in and play. Your main concern as a parent will be that they are not knocked over by a passing canoeist!To locate the hire companies drive to Collias or stop at the one just outside Remoulins on the road to Uz�s.

                    Council Special Report   

                                  Since 2000, President Robert Mugabe’s refusal to tolerate challenges to his power has led him to systematically dismantle the workings of Zimbabwe’s economic and political systems, replacing them with structures of corruption, intimidation, and repression. Michelle D. Gavin surveys the current situation in Zimbabwe, identifying current structural and legal impediments to economic and political recovery.

          Bernard Gwertzman   has spent his entire career in journalism, starting as a reporter for the   Washington Star   in Washington, DC, in 1960. There he covered the Cold War as a specialist on Communist affairs. In late 1968, he was hired by the   New York Times   and sent to Moscow as its bureau chief from 1969-71, where he covered the tensions along the Soviet-Chinese border and the first steps toward detente.   In 1971, Gwertzman returned to Washington, where he worked for the next sixteen years covering U.S. foreign policy for the   Times  . He traveled throughout the Middle East with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, where he charted the first Arab-Israeli accords, leading up to the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel brokered by President Carter in 1979. In that period, he also wrote extensively on the first arms control accords between the United States and Russia.   With the advent of President Reagan to the White House in 1981, he covered the chill in Soviet-American relations, followed by the warming of the Gorbachev-Reagan ties. In 1987, Gwertzman was invited to New York to become the deputy foreign editor of the   Times  , and in 1989, he became foreign editor. During his tenure as foreign editor, he directed the   Times  ' coverage of the collapse of the Soviet empire, the Persian Gulf war, the U.S. invasion of Panama, the first Israeli agreement with the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), and the outbreak of the Bosnian war. In the six years Mr. Gwertzman was at the helm, the   New York Times   won four Pulitzer Prizes for international coverage.   When the   Times   began its electronic division in the summer of 1995, Mr. Gwertzman shifted to new media. He was editor-in-chief of the   New York Times   on the web from 1996 until he retired from the   Times   in 2002. He has been consulting editor for cfr.org since October 2002. Gwertzman, who has an AB and MA from Harvard, is the co-author with Haynes Johnson of   Fulbright: the Dissenter  , and with Michael Kaufman on three anthologies on the fall of Communism and the breakup of the Soviet Union. He lives in Riverdale, NY, with his wife Marie-Jeanne. He has two married sons, James and Michael.

It hasn't taken long for   Kermit Davis   to rekindle winning ways and build a solid and still-growing fan base since being hired as the 19th men's head basketball coach at Middle Tennessee in April 2002.       
In fact, the Blue Raiders have won as such a rate during the previous four years; Davis already is in elite company when it comes to the Middle Tennessee hoops fraternity.      
Davis' Blue Raiders have turned in winning seasons in each of his first four years, making him just one of two of the 19 Middle Tennessee men's basketball coaches to accomplish that feat. The other was former coach Bruce Stewart. Middle Tennessee is 68-50 on the hardwood since Davis' arrival, representing the second most wins for any of the Blue Raiders' 19 head coaches after their first four seasons. Only Stewart (62) had more victories after his first four seasons.      
So pleased with Davis' performance and the first-class manner in which he runs every aspect of his program, Chris Massaro immediately extended the successful coach's contract through the 2010 season upon being named Director of Athletics in April 2005, and the highly-regarded veteran coach has since had his contract extended through the 2011 campaign.        
Davis' accomplishments at Middle Tennessee not only have him ranked among the most successful coaches in program history, but they have fans excited about a growing program with a solid base.      
There's good reason for the excitement as Middle Tennessee has enjoyed four consecutive winning seasons for the first time since the 1985-89 seasons, and the Blue Raiders have averaged 17 wins per season under Davis, which is the best four-year mark since 1985-89. Furthermore, Middle Tennessee has averaged 17 wins per season under Davis, which is the best four-year mark since 1985-89.      
The well liked and community-minded Davis not only is getting results on the court, but fans have noticed the resurgence in the men's basketball program and they have responded at the box office. Middle Tennessee has enjoyed an attendance increase in each of Davis' first four seasons and, overall, attendance has doubled since Davis' arrival - realizing the largest increase of any Sun Belt Conference member during the past four seasons. Middle Tennessee realized a Sun Belt Conference high 4,843 in average attendance for league home games in 2005-06. A Murphy Center attendance record of 11,807 was set on February 26, 2004; when fans flocked to the ""Glass House"" to cheer Middle Tennessee to a 73-59 win against three-time defending Sun Belt champion Western Kentucky.       
Prior to Davis landing the Middle Tennessee job in April 2002, Middle Tennessee men's basketball fans had little cause for celebration. The Blue Raiders had endured losing seasons in three of the previous four years, but the energetic and highly successful Davis quickly changed the fortunes and began a Blue Raider revival. He has produced a 66-50 mark in his first four seasons, including a 60-42 record since the start of Sun Belt play in January, 2003. Not bad for a program that had enjoyed just one conference tournament win in the two years prior to his arrival.      
The Blue Raider Nation would have to be patient, Davis warned; because winning programs aren't built overnight. It takes time, solid recruiting classes, and the installation of a philosophy to ultimately reach long-term goals. But in four short years under Davis, Middle Tennessee has been in the Sun Belt championship hunt into the final week of each season.       
The Blue Raiders reached the Sun Belt Tournament title game in 2003, their first appearance in a conference tournament championship since 1989; and they missed the chance to make it two league title games in as many years when they dropped a 70-66 decision to Louisiana-Lafayette in 2004 in the semifinals. Winning is not the sole trademark that has brought fans back to Murphy Center. The style of play is as noteworthy.      
""One thing our team will do is play with a great deal of energy,"" Davis said. ""We would like to play a hard-nosed, aggressive style that our fans will enjoy night-in, night-out. We're going to share and value the basketball, rebound on both ends, and attempt to get a quality shot on each possession.""      
Just as he has done at previous stops, Davis has developed a program that suddenly has expectations placed on it. Even though the Blue Raider program has made great strides in a short time, Davis says the foundation doesn't change. The building process continues into Davis' fifth season.      
When former athletics director Boots Donnelly introduced Davis as the program's 19th head coach, he told a press conference filled with media and supporters that he felt he had hired the right person to return the program to past glory and once again contend for conference titles and NCAA Tournament appearances.      
""I wanted to bring someone in here that wanted to be here, not just be a head coach, but who wanted to take over our program,"" Donnelly said. ""I wanted a person that believed very, very strongly in discipline, because that's the process that gets it all started. I wanted a heck of a recruiter, and I also wanted a teacher. I think we fulfilled every one of those things with   Kermit Davis  , Jr.""      
It didn't take long for Donnelly's words to prove prophetic.  In his first season as the Blue Raiders' head coach, Davis inherited a group of players who had never enjoyed success as members of the Sun Belt. The 2002-03 Blue Raiders were picked fourth (of five) teams in the Sun Belt's East Division, and eighth of 11 teams overall. Heading into the final week of the regular-season, Middle Tennessee remained in the championship hunt. For his efforts, Davis was named the Sun Belt Conference Coach of the Year, marking the second time in five years as a Division I head coach he had been so honored.      
While Davis' first team surprised many by reaching the finals of the Sun Belt Tournament and putting together the most wins for a Blue Raider squad (16) since the 1997-98 campaign, his second Blue Raider team had to be even more surprising.      
Middle Tennessee entered the 2003-04 season with only one returning starter and four letter winners from Davis' initial Blue Raider team, but the proven winner molded his squad into a championship contender by mid-season. The Blue Raiders increased their number of wins and had fans coming through the turnstiles in record numbers with an exciting style of play.      
Middle Tennessee went a step beyond in 2004-05 when the Blue Raiders posted a 19-win season in Davis' third season, marking the first time since 1997-98 that the team had won as many games.      
Davis' players not only have been winners on the court, but they have been successful in the classroom, as well. Eleven of the 15 seniors in the Middle Tennessee program since Davis' hiring have received their degree. Three of the four who haven't earned their degree are either playing professionally or are in NBA camps.      
Like all successful coaches, Davis has been victorious by recruiting players who fit the personality of the team and take ownership of their squad. The previous three recruiting classes have been ranked No. 1 in the Sun Belt by Hoop Scoop magazine, and each has been rated among the Top 25 in the nation, including a No. 11 signing class in 2004.      
By recruiting players who value character, have a high level of toughness, and have a desire to obtain a college degree, Davis has been able to develop a winning formula not only at Middle Tennessee, but also at each of his stops.      
Prior to being named the head coach at Middle Tennessee, Davis spent five seasons as the associate head coach at LSU under head coach John Brady. Prior to Davis' arrival with Brady at LSU, the Tigers had been languishing near the bottom of the SEC.       
It didn't take long for the team's fortunes to change. After two seasons of putting the pieces together, the Tigers captured the SEC title in 2000 and went on to an appearance in the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. The Tigers returned to the postseason in 2002 with a trip to the National Invitational Tournament. In the three years immediately preceding Davis' arrival in Murfreesboro, LSU averaged 20-plus wins per season.      
Davis said of his time in Baton Rouge, La., ""I enjoyed five years at LSU working with a close friend and one of the outstanding coaches in college basketball in John Brady.""  Before LSU, Davis spent one season as the head coach at the University of Idaho; however, his stint with the Vandals was his second tour of duty in Moscow. He also served as the school's head coach from 1989-90. During his three years as the head coach at Idaho, Davis compiled a 63-29 record, the best three-year total in the program's history. Davis posted two of the best single-season tallies in school history during his first two seasons at Idaho as well, turning in 25-6 marks in both of those seasons (1988-89, 1989-90).      
His Idaho squad won the Big Sky championship in 1989 and went on to capture the league's tournament crown and a berth into the NCAA Tournament, as well. For his efforts, Davis was named Big Sky Coach of the Year. History repeated itself in 1990 when Davis once again led the Vandals to the Big Sky title in both the regular season and tournament, garnering yet another NCAA Tournament berth.      
 In fact, Davis himself made history when he became the Vandals' head coach in 1988. Upon his hiring, Davis was the youngest Division I head coach in the nation at age 28.  It was not the first time Davis had been the youngest head coach in the country. When he was hired as the head coach at Southwest Mississippi Junior College in 1984, he became the youngest junior college coach in the nation at age 24. His youth served him well at Southwest Mississippi, as he put together a 39-20 record in two seasons. His 1986 squad won 22 games, posting the school's first 20-win season in 17 years.      
His success at the junior college level landed him a spot on Tim Floyd's staff at Idaho, where Davis served as an assistant for two years prior to being named the program's head coach.      
After spending two seasons as the head coach at Idaho, Davis went on to become the head coach at Texas A&M for the 1990-91 campaign. From Texas A&M, Davis moved on to serve as associate head coach at Chipola Junior College for two seasons before ascending to the top spot for the 1993-94 campaign. During his season as the team's head coach, Chipola finished the season ranked No. 4 in the national polls and posted a 27-5 record, giving the team the second-most wins in school history.      
From Chipola, Davis moved on to serve as associate head coach at Utah State from 1995-96. At Utah State, Davis coached under current Southern Mississippi coach Larry Eustachy, and the pair combined to win the Big West championship in 1995. His Utah State tenure ended with his return to Idaho as the Vandals' head coach and the rest is history.      
Davis' rapid ascent up the coaching ladder is no coincidence. He has been around the game his entire life, growing up watching one of the preeminent coaches in the country operate on a daily basis.   Kermit Davis  , Sr., was one of the most respected college coaches in the nation, and the younger Davis spent many hours around his dad in the gym and even on the bench during games.      
After completing his playing career at Mississippi State, Davis began his coaching career at his alma mater as a graduate assistant on Bob Boyd's staff from 1983-84. Davis earned his bachelor's degree from Mississippi State in 1982 and then obtained his master's degree there in 1984.  Davis, a native of Leakesville, Miss., and his wife, Betty, have two daughters, Ally (18) and Claire (13).

  INTRODUCTION  
  Charles River Laboratories' executive management is responsible for the completeness 
  and accuracy of its financial reporting and the adequacy of its internal financial 
  and operating controls. Its Board of Directors has responsibility to oversee 
  management's discharge of these responsibilities. To assist the Board, the Corporation 
  has established, through its   
  Bylaws, an Audit Committee whose authority and responsibilities are described 
  by this Charter.  
  PURPOSE  
  This Charter is created in order to define the Audit Committee's objectives, 
  the range of its authority, the scope of its activities and its duties and responsibilities. 
  It is intended to give Audit Committee members, management, external and internal 
  auditors a clear understanding of their respective roles. The Audit Committee 
  and the Board of Directors will review and assess the adequacy of this Charter 
  periodically but at least annually.  
  MISSION STATEMENT  
  The Audit Committee is created by the Board of Directors of the Company to:

    assist the Board in its oversight of  

     the integrity of the financial statements of the Company;  
     the qualifications, independence and performance of the Company's independent 
  auditor;   
    the performance of the Company's internal audit function; and  
    compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements; and  

    prepare the Audit Committee report that Securities and Exchange Commission 
  rules require to be included in the Company's annual proxy statement.  

    GENERAL GUIDELINES  
  Size, Composition and Term of Appointment  
   The Audit Committee is a committee of the Board of Directors and will consist 
  of no fewer than three directors, each of whom will meet the independence and 
  experience requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") and 
  at least one of whom will have accounting or related financial management expertise 
  to qualify as a ""financial expert"" as defined by the relevant rules 
  promulgated by the NYSE, Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB""), 
  Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""), National Association of 
  Securities Dealers (""NASD"") or other regulatory bodies. The Corporate 
  Governance and Nominating Committee will recommend nominees for appointment 
  to the Audit Committee annually and as vacancies or newly created positions 
  occur. Audit Committee members will be appointed by the Board and may be removed 
  by the Board at any time. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee 
  will recommend to the Board, and the Board will designate, the Chair of the 
  Audit Committee.  
  Meetings

  out its responsibilities under this charter, but not less frequently than quarterly.

  will determine the frequency and length of the committee meetings and will set 
  meeting agendas consistent with this charter.  
  Oversight by the Board of Directors  
  The Committee will report its activities to the full Board on a regular 
  basis so that the Board is kept informed of its activities on a current basis. 
  This report will include a review of any issues that arise with respect to the 
  quality or integrity of the Company's financial statements, the Company's compliance 
  with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications, independence and 
  performance of the Company's independent auditor, the performance of the internal 
  audit function, and any other matters that the Audit Committee deems appropriate 
  or is requested to be included by the Board. The Committee will perform all 
  duties determined by the Board.   
    The Board will determine annually that the Committee's members are independent 
  and that the Committee has fulfilled its duties and responsibilities.  

  Authority  
  The Committee derives its authority from the By-Laws of the Corporation and 
  is hereby given all resources and authority necessary to properly discharge 
  its duties and responsibilities. The Committee acts on the Board's behalf in 
  matters outlined below.

  to confer privately with the Committee, without the presence of management.

  At least annually, the Committee will evaluate its own performance and report 
  to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee on such evaluation.  
    The Committee will periodically review and assess the adequacy of this charter 
  and recommend any proposed changes to the Corporate Governance and Nominating 
  Committee.  

    PROCEDURES  
  The Committee will meet separately, periodically, with management, with internal 
  auditors or other personnel responsible for the internal audit function and 
  with the independent auditor.

  legal, accounting or other advisors and may request any officer or employee 
  of the Company or the Company's outside counsel or independent auditor to meet 
  with any members of, or advisors to, the Audit Committee.   
    The Committee may delegate its authority to subcommittees or the Chair of the 
  Audit Committee when it deems appropriate and in the best interests of the Company.  
    LIMITATIONS INHERENT IN THE AUDIT COMMITTEE'S ROLE  

  It is not the duty of the Audit Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine 
  that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate and are in 
  accordance with GAAP. This is the responsibility of management and the independent 
  auditor. Furthermore, while the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing 
  the Company's policies and practices with respect to risk assessment and management, 
  it is the responsibility of the CEO and senior management to determine the appropriate 
  level of the Company's exposure to risk.  

    AMENDMENT  

  This charter may be amended by a majority of the independent members of the 
  Board of Directors.

From 1973 to 1975, she conducted research for her master’s thesis in the field of mechanisms and kinetics of ionic diffusion in sodium beta-alumina. In 1975, she was invited to participate in research at Harwell Laboratories in Oxford, England, as a visiting scientist. Her work there involved the wetting behavior of liquids on solid substrates. Following her work in England, she accepted a senior research engineer position with Rockwell International Space Division in Downey, California. Her responsibilities there included developing equipment and processes for the manufacture of the Space Shuttle thermal protection system in Palmdale, California. She also represented Rockwell International as a member of the Dr. Kraft Ehricke evaluation committee on prospective space industrialization concepts. Dr. Dunbar completed her doctorate at the University of Houston in Houston, Texas. Her multi-disciplinary dissertation (materials science and physiology) involved evaluating the effects of simulated space flight on bone strength and fracture toughness. These results were correlated to alterations in hormonal and metabolic activity. She is currently an adjunct assistant professor in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Houston.  
  She is a private pilot with over 200 hours in single engine land aircraft, has logged more than 700 hours flying time in T-38 jets as co-pilot, and has over 100 hours as co-pilot in a Cessna Citation Jet.  
  NASA EXPERIENCE:  
  Dr. Dunbar accepted a position as a payload officer/flight controller at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in 1978. She served as a guidance and navigation officer/flight controller for the Skylab reentry mission in 1979 and was subsequently designated project officer/payload officer for the integration of several Space Shuttle payloads.  
  Dr. Dunbar became a NASA astronaut in August 1981. Her technical assignments have included assisting in the verification of Shuttle flight software at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), serving as a member of the Flight Crew Equipment Control Board, participation as a member of the Astronaut Office Science Support Group, supporting operational development of the remote manipulator system (RMS). She has served as chief of the Mission Development Branch, as the Astronaut Office interface for “secondary” payloads, and as lead for the Science Support Group. In 1993, Dr. Dunbar served as Deputy Associate Administrator, Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. In February 1994, she traveled to Star City, Russia, where she spent 13-months training as a back-up crew member for a 3-month flight on the Russian Space Station, Mir. In March 1995, she was certified by the Russian Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center as qualified to fly on long duration Mir Space Station flights. From October 1995 to November 1996, she was detailed to the NASA JSC Mission Operations Directorate as Assistant Director where she was responsible for chairing the International Space Station Training Readiness Reviews, and facilitating Russian/American operations and training strategies.  
  A veteran of five space flights, Dr. Dunbar has logged more than 1,208 hours (50 days) in space. She served as a mission specialist on STS 61-A in 1985, STS-32 in 1990, and STS-71 in 1995, and was the Payload Commander on STS-50 in 1992, and STS-89 in 1998.  
  SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE:  
  STS 61-A Challenger (October 30-November 6, 1985), was the West German D-1 Spacelab mission. It was the first to carry eight crew members, the largest to fly in space, and was also the first in which payload activities were controlled from outside the United States. More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological sciences, materials science, biology, and navigation. During the flight, Dr. Dunbar was responsible for operating Spacelab and its subsystems and performing a variety of experiments. Her mission training included six months of experiment training in Germany, France, Switzerland, and The Netherlands. STS 61-A launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Mission duration was 7 days, 44 minutes 51 seconds, traveling 2.5 million miles in 111 orbits of the Earth.  
  STS-32 Columbia (January 9-20, 1990), launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to a night landing at Edwards Air Base in California. During the flight, the crew successfully deployed the Syncom IV-F5 satellite, and retrieved the 21,400-pound Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) using the RMS. They also operated a variety of middeck experiments including the Microgravity Disturbance Experiment (MDE) using the Fluids Experiment Apparatus (FEA), Protein Crystal Growth (PCG), American Flight Echocardiograph (AFE), Latitude/Longitude Locator (L3), Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE), Characterization of Neurospora Circadian Rhythms (CNCR),and the IMAX Camera. Dr. Dunbar was principal investigator for the MDE/FEA Experiment. Additionally, numerous medical test objectives, including in-flight lower body negative pressure (LBNP), in-flight aerobic exercise and muscle performance were conducted to evaluate human adaptation to extended duration missions. Mission duration was 10 days, 21 hours, 01 minute, 38 seconds, traveling 4.5 million miles in 173 orbits of the Earth.  
  STS-50 Columbia, USML-1 (June 25 to July 9, 1992). Dr. Dunbar was the Payload Commander on the United States Microgravity Lab-1 mission which was dedicated to microgravity fluid physics and materials science. Over 30 experiments sponsored by over 100 investigators were housed in the “Spacelab” in the Shuttle’s Payload Bay. A payload crew of 4 operated around-the-clock for 13 days performing experiments in scientific disciplines such as protein crystal growth, electronic and infrared detector crystal growth, surface tension physics, zeolite crystal growth, and human physiology. Mission duration was 13 days, 19 hours, 30 minutes and 4 seconds, traveling 5.7 million miles in 221 orbits of the Earth.  
  STS-71 Atlantis (June 27 to July 7, 1995), was the first Space Shuttle mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir, and involved an exchange of crews. The Atlantis was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station. Dr. Dunbar served as MS-3 on this flight which also carried a Spacelab module in the payload bay in which the crew performed medical evaluations on the returning Mir crew. These evaluations included ascertaining the effects of weightlessness on the cardio/vascular system, the bone/muscle system, the immune system, and the cardio/pulmonary system. Mission duration was 9 days, 19 hours, 23 minutes and 8 seconds, traveling 4.1 million miles in 153 orbits of the earth.  
  STS-89 Endeavor (January 22-31, 1998), was the eighth Shuttle-Mir docking mission during which the crew transferred more than 9,000 pounds of scientific equipment, logistical hardware and water from Space Shuttle Endeavor to Mir. In the fifth and last exchange of a U.S. astronaut, STS-89 delivered Andy Thomas to Mir and returned with David Wolf. Mission duration was 8 days, 19 hours and 47 seconds, traveling 3.6 million miles in 138 orbits of the Earth. Dr. Dunbar was the Payload Commander, responsible for all payload activities including the conduct of 23 technology and science experiments.

  STAR PARK : PARKING ON THE RISE™  

										  A Company with Roots  

										  Star Park   was formed in 1997 and currently operates a system of 36 parking and valet locations that include high-rise garages and surface lots in Portland's Central City and Vancouver, Washington. Our parent company,   BPM Development  , has heritage in the Northwest's property development scene that stretches back more than 70 years. Over the years, it outsourced the parking management function of various developments, but was never satisfied with the customer service or the integrity of the local providers. In 1997 with the opening of its Alder Street Garage and Retail Center, BPM recognized an opportunity to bring an honest, service-oriented approach to the parking management industry in Portland. 
										A team of industry veterans who shared this philosophy was established. That group remains in place today and the   Star Park   management team has more than 30 years of experience within the Portland parking market, including first-hand knowledge of nearly every major downtown parking facility.

										  A Satisfied Staff is a Serving Staff  

										Not only is   Star Park  's top management tremendously experienced, our entire staff is quality-conscious and service-oriented. Our parking attendants receive extensive training in every aspect of their jobs, including customer service, accounting and cash control, vehicle and customer safety, company policy and lot/garage operations. We insist on:

											  Clean, well-maintained facilities  
											  Friendly, courteous, well-trained employees  
											  Attentive, personal service  

										  Star Park   is committed to employment longevity; we value our employees' commitment and dedication by offering a comprehensive benefit package for all eligible employees that includes paid vacation, sick pay, holiday pay, group life insurance, health care benefits with a Section 125C pre-tax option and a 401(k) retirement plan.

										  Trust and Responsibility  

										Our integrated revenue management system records are audited daily. For lots that generate high volumes in a short period of time, bonded personnel perform cash sweeps and deposit funds into a safe. We provide you with extensive reports customized to your needs, detailing daily, weekly and monthly activity. For managed properties, we set up a client trust account into which all revenues are immediately deposited. This allows you to start earning interest the day you earn the money.

  ** Expanded team **  

  QualCore Logic   announced it has expanded its team with additional analog expertise by hiring 50 additional engineers over the past year. The company says its team now has 60+ analog engineers split between a design center in Hyderabad, India, and the QualCore Logic design center and corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale, CA. The company also says that it plans to expand that headcount to 100 in 2005.   

  Per the Press Release: ""The analog engineers have completed more than 30 analog and mixed-signal designs in 2004 and increased the QualCore Logic analog and mixed-signal IP and special I/O portfolio to more than 400 cores.""  

  I spoke by phone on December 7th with Company President   Mahendra Jain   about the announcement.   

  Jain told me, "" A lot of analog design work going on today. If you look at it historically, most companies in India � especially, IP companies like ours � have done digital work, but not much analog work. We started to focus however, on analog two years ago, when we acquired an analog team locally, then started one in analog in India.""   

  ""People are very interested in analog IP, so there was a natural rational for us [in pursuing this course]. It's difficult to find analog talent here in North America, and it's difficult in India as well. So, we hired engineers in India and brought them here to train them alongside our senior analog guys here.""  

  ""We've developed a range of analog IP over these last several years. Now we have the two teams working � in North American and in India � and they're providing [together] as a good team developing IP on a joint basis.""  

  ""We've also taken the step of hiring fresh grads here in the U.S. who want to move back to India. However, [no matter where we hire], we need to team up new engineers with experienced engineers and have them learn from real projects. That's the only you way you can build a team, and [through that process] we believe that we now have an extremely credible team.""  

  ** New members **  

  Open Core Protocol International Partnership   (OCP-IP) announced four new members including:   3plus1 Technology  ,   AccelChip Inc.  ,   Hantro Products OY  , and   Synfora  . Per the Press Release: ""The new members represent a wide variety of markets and product offerings, illustrating the industry-wide acceptance and adoption of OCP.""  

  ** New website **  

  Cadence Design Systems, Inc.   announced its collaboration with   IBM   to launch Power.org, which the companies describe as ""an open standards community that will help IC designers develop SoCs using the IBM PowerPC Architecture. Power.org is dedicated to promoting the IBM PowerPC Architecture as the preferred open-standard hardware-development platform for electronic systems for markets such as consumer electronics, networking, storage, military and automotive.""  

  ** New channels **  

  Synfora, Inc.   is expanding its U.S. sales channel by naming of   Design Automation Solutions, Inc.   (DASI) as channel partner for the South Central U.S. The companies announced that   Scott Spurlin   and   Doug Peterson   will managing the DASI team for Synfora. Simon Napper, CEO of Synfora, is quoted:""[Synfora's] PICO Express has demonstrated that it saves design time and costs in implementing compute-intensive applications in hardware. There are many companies in the South Central region that would benefit from the product.""  

  ** New awards **  

  eASIC Corp.   announced that the company was awarded ""Top 100 Most Innovative Companies"" by   Red Herring Inc.   Per the Press Release: ""The top 100 innovators were selected after a long and rigorous process of evaluating more than 1,200 entries � This award recognizes eASIC�s breakthrough technology in the area of chip customization for which the company holds 11 broad patents.""  

  ** Stock update **  

  Synopsys, Inc.   announced that its Board of Directors has renewed its stock repurchase program last renewed in December 2003.   

  Per the Press Release: ""Under the renewed program, the Company may repurchase Synopsys common stock with a market value up to $500 million (not including amounts purchased to date under the program) on the open market.

  Sara Violi : Alumni : Merchandise Marketing : FIDM  

    Sarah Violi  
    Founder and President of KAZ  

    When 
      Sara Violi   started FIDM in 1993 she had no idea what twists and turns life 
    had in store for her. Her education at FIDM would span over two majors and 
    would ultimately lead her into owning her own children's clothing business, 
    Kaz.   

    While attending high school Sara worked part-time for an interior designer. 
    That experience lead her to enrolling in the Interior Design program at FIDM. 
    Recognizing the economy at the time was changing, Sara changed her major to 
    Merchandise Marketing. Sara explained,""People weren't interested in spending 
    the money for an interior designer and I felt a merchandising degree from 
    FIDM would expand my horizons in the fashion industry"".   

    Sara took some time off from her studies to raise a family. She returned 
    to FIDM to finish her education in 1997. It was during her last quarter that 
    Sara had a vision to create outfits for her daughter when she performed at 
    dance recitals. Without any prior knowledge of patterns, cutting, sewing or 
    textiles, Sarah started to design and create her vision.  
    Using 
    a leased sewing machine she created outfits that were soon coveted by other 
    parents at the recitals. Sara realized that there was a market for her creations. 
    She started Kasrum 4 Kicks which eventually evolved into Kaz. She started 
    out small, but demands were so high that she had to outsource her patterns 
    and sewing to keep up.   
    Sara 
    designs all her clothing for a wide range of activities so parents won't have 
    to worry about changing their children's outfits before each of their daily 
    activities. Sara explained, ""Kaz designs can be worn from school, to piano 
    rehearsal, to dinner"". Kaz has grown tremendously in a short amount of time 
    with Nordstrom being the latest to pick up the line. Stores across the nation 
  now carry the Kaz label.  

    Sara's future plans include launching a new boys line this year and having 
    a Kaz store in Las Vegas by 2002. Sara's advice for students who want to break 
    into the fashion industry is to find their niche. Sara believes that there 
    is room for everyone in the industry and once you find the place where you 
    can create and thrive you can be as successful as you want to be.

  MAX SCIANDRI  : The Pez Interview!  Monday, August 16, 2004  10:07:37 AM PT  
  by Richard Pestes  

  Max is a great interview �  open, candid, and keen to talk about everything.  Still, we barely scratched the surface on his 16 years as a pro rider�  I first rang him on his cell phone.  He was driving his kids to a recital, so we had to connect a few days later.   

We talked a bit about his recent retirement, but the most interesting stuff came when Max talked about his many many experiences as a pro, like beating Greg Lemond, getting pipped by Riis, and how much things have changed in the last 16 years�  

  Here�s Max at the Tour of Flanders start this Spring.  

  Max Sciandri   turned pro in �89, and rode through the era of Indurain, and well into the era of Armstrong.  He�s seen so much, and done a ton, where do you start to ask questions?  Actually it was easy � Max is so relaxed, and talkative that the conversation just flowed from one topic to the next � it really did feel like we were having beers in the pub instead of chatting on the phone some 5000 miles apart.  

Max was born in the UK, and learned his English there, so listening to him is a cheerful exercise in placing his accent � it�s sort of Nigel Hufnell meets Marcello Mastroianni � hard to place and totally unique � much like Dunc Steele must sound like to an Italian!  He speaks both slowly and thoughtfully, then accelerates into a quick rhythm as only an Italian can�  

When we talked a couple of weeks ago, Max was still enjoying the novelty of having no races or training to do�  

  HANGIN� UP THE WHEELS  
PEZ:  I actually heard about your retirement after I had contacted your team press guy at CSC to request this interview, and of course I was surprised - .  So what led to your decision to retire?  

Max:  � Wellll you know, there�s one, and a lot, and no factors� it came to the point that 16 years is a long time.  And I started to lose a little bit of motivation, even though this year was with a great team, and I went to the Tour de Georgia, then after I went to Miami to relax a bit with my brother [who lives there], and when I came back home, I just couldn�t get on my bike again, and I just said � that�s it.  And that was it!  

  Max gets the win in Stradella at the �94 Giro.  

PEZ: Just like that�?  

Max: Just like that, just like that...  So, right now I�m doing gardening, just working on my house, relaxing with the kids � doing the things you kind of haven�t done before.  I went to the beach with Rolf Sorenson yesterday, and we had a couple of days out with our families.  Just little things like that you know?  No stress whatsoever.  Not thinking about getting to a race, or is my form okay� just taking it easy.  This weekend I�m going to Los Angeles to see my family [Max�s parents live in LA, and own a restaurant called �Ago� (pronounced: AH-go), serving classic Tuscan food.- ed.], plus we�re opening a new one called �Soertino� in Florence.  

  Max has been offered a position in the family-run restaurant business, and is currently looking into it, but declined to say too much, preferring to wait until it�s done.  

Max:  So that�s about it, that�s something what (sic) really got me going with the decision.   I�m glad, you know � when I called up Bjarne Riis, it was a bit hard that moment, then I felt better after, and now I�m quite happy.  

You know, I�ve been on my bike since I was 9 years old�  

PEZ:  Have you been riding in the last month � since you decided to stop?  

Max: Yeah a bit, on and off.  As you know in this area, in Tuscany, there are sooo many riders, Ballerini, Sorenson, Scinto, myself, we just get out on a nice little couple hour rides�  Just cycling for fun.  

It�s funny, because a lot of friends, people I know.. �so, what are you doing? Are you working?�  Listen � I want to RELAX.  Take it easy � you know a couple months EASY.  I�ve been running around all my life and now I just want �think� about what I�m gonna do�  have a look from the outside.   

  Giro �94 again � this time in the hill climb TT.  

  HOW ABOUT CSC  
PEZ: Back in Tour de France 94 or 95, you were outsprinted for a stage win by Bjarne Riis.  In the interview after, you just spat the words into camera: ""Jesus� beaten by a guy like Riis!"" Did you and Bjarne ever talk about that race?  

Max: You still remember that�?  Well that�s funny, because basically I didn�t even know who Bjarne was.  It was a day we had a breakaway of like 5 or 6 riders, the strongest rider was Museeuw, and I thought �if I can beat this guy then it�s done� � you know?  And Phil Anderson and Alvaro Mejia from Motorola were also in the break, and they really went flat out that day.  Well the last 15k, Bjarne Riis didn�t pull a meter, he just sat on the wheels. And so Museeuw�s the main guy, and Riis is just sort of sitting on the wheel, and nobody said nothing to him because nobody really cared much�  And here I am, flat out and sprinting with Museeuw - - - and like �yeah I got it I got it!�  And I�m just about to lift my hands up�and at 50 meters � I�m very close to the barriers� he [Riis] just pops his wheel through between me and the barriers� and boom � he lifts his hands up and he wins.    

And I�m like: �I caaannn�t believe it��  

  You can still hear the disbelief in Max�s voice�  

PEZ:  So did you ever talk about that?  

Max:  No we didn�t, but I was really pissed with him, cuz then he started to live around this area, and we started to meet at the airport� I didn�t talk to him for a year or two after that.  

PEZ:  (�laughing�) So to this day you�ve never talked about it?  

Max:  No.  -  we haven�t.  That�s a funny thing you remembered!  

PEZ:  I want to ask you about CSC.  We�ve heard a lot about how Bjarne structures his team so much differently from other teams � what�s it really like in there?  

Max:  Well, I wouldn�t say sooo much differently� it was a lot on � on honesty, talking a lot and having good relations with your teammates.  

PEZ:  Is that unusual � is it a unique aspect to pro teams?  

Max:  Well, I�ve seen a lot of teams, you know� but talking and saying what you think in the right way, it helps a lot.  It can be hard sometimes, and be a bit tough on people, if you say something that is not the best thing to say � but then it clears up any problems you know.  In terms of talking and getting the team to work together � that was something that was really different from all the other teams.  

  Casa Max: Here�s what 16 years as a top pro can earn you...  your own Tuscan villa.  It�s: �up in the hills, 220 odd trees, in a renovated 200 year old house, all stone.  It�s got a natural spring, views, every year I make my own olive oil.�  

PEZ:  It�s one thing to talk about these things, but it�s another to make them actually happen�  did you see that these things actually happened?    

Max:  Yeah � they actually happened, because if you look at the results at the beginning of the season, you see the team was riding really well� but again, there were so many people from all over the world, it still made keeping this thing going quite hard.  And even with Ferretti at Technogym-MG, the team worked really well, because Ferretti knew how to get the best out of every rider.  

CSC was a team that was 100% behind the rider in terms of equipment, and training camps � it was really good.  

PEZ:  Was it a �fun� team to be on?  You know, as teams go�  

Max:  I was very pleased and honored to be on this team.  I saw that a lot of people really wanted to be on this team�  I noticed it right away.  

  FROM INDURAIN TO ARMSTRONG  
PEZ: You�ve raced through both the Indurain era, to well into the Armstrong era, and of course the years in between.  Can you tell us a bit about how things have changed over that time?   

Max:  Well, I�ll say that the main thing that�s changed a lot is RESPECT.  That�s something that is really lost in today�s racing.  The young riders, they don�t have the respect for someone who�s been around for many years.  

It�s the way they race, for example, in Tirreno Adriatico 3-4 years ago, in a sprint � it�s 3-4 kms before the sprint and riders are starting to go a bit for position, and moving along, and here comes this young sprinter from one of the smaller Italian teams, and he goes up to Rolf Sorenson, and he hits him with his elbow on his side � you know on his stomach!  And I see the guy, and I ride up to him and I say �You hit Rolf Sorenson!  When he was winning Tirreno in 1988 you were probly a f**kin junior!� I screamed at him.  And that just shows that there was no respect.  When you�re a little kid, and you turn pro, and you�re racing with people you�ve seen on tv for years�  and then you show no respect�  That shows a lot how it is now with cycling.  

  The 95 Tour with MG-Technogym.  

PEZ:  So if you�re a young pro, and you�re new to the peloton, what�s the best way to earn the respect of the older guys in the bunch?  

Max: LISTEN! And don�t talk so much.  Listen, and let the other guys talk� that�s what I did.  And then you get a little result here, and a little result there�  

Basically, if I could suggest anything to any young riders, it�s to step in and� listen a lot, and don�t just throw yourself here and there � always talking�  Show respect � it�s the same in life as in sport.    

PEZ:  What do you think of the new crop of young American racers?  Guys like Tom Danielson, Tim Johnson, David Clinger � all who�ve joined the Euro-bunch this year�   

Max:  They�re okay actually � they�re nice guys.  I�ve talked to them a bit and they�re okay.  It�s not very easy being an American guy and just thrown into some team, and have to adapt.  You have to have a � very adventurous spirit to just go in Spain, or Italy or France�There�s a lot of hunger to be in a big team.     

PEZ:  Is it easier now, or back in the Indurain era to join the pro ranks?  

Max:  Hmm� Maybe it was easier then.  Because they had maybe a few more workers -  �gregari�- today more and more people want to win, and everyone wants to have their [UCI] points.  In the old days when I turned pro, there was no points at the beginning, so you know a team had 1 or 2 leaders and you worked for these guys.  Today you work your ass off the whole year, and the you have 100 points and you want to find a new team  and they say �What you got? � oh you got 100 points?�  And maybe you helped a guy win 5 races but the points they seem to count for more than the whole thing I think.  So sometimes you don�t really give everything to help because maybe you want your own points.  So in the early days it was a bit easier for a young rider because they knew that when they joined the team, there was maybe an Argentin, or somebody else, and you just had to work for him�  And then slowly slowly they�d find their own little space� between the seasons to get their own result.  

PEZ:  Are the races faster now than they used to be?  

Max:  Yeah.  I found that the gears everybody pulls are harder, in terms of going up a hill, they�ll pull bigger gears than in the old days.  I remember when we put on the 11!  We used to have 12 you know � and I thought ��what the f**K�?!�    

PEZ:   Did you have �FUN� through your career?  

Max:  I had a lot of fun� till� (phew..) a few years ago.  Basically the mobile phones, when they came out, it made everybody a bit more individual in terms of after the race. After dinner, everybody used to just hang around in the hotels in the lobby and talk together you know?  And today, everybody�s got a computer and they�ve got to send out emails. And they�ve got a cellular phone and they have to do a round of calls here and there� So it tends to be more of everyone on their own�  In the old days everyone just used to hang around together a bit more.  

  Max rode with seven teams in his career, including FDJeux in 1997.  

PEZ:  In the older days, or even now, did your wife ever travel to races?  

Max:  Yeah she used to come sometimes, not often though.  In the old days it was almost forbidden� I remember in my second year I went with Carrera and Davide Boifava, and my wife came up to our room to change our little baby, and I was like [exasperated] �f**k! move move quickly-quickly change the nappy and go-go-go!� I was like� afraid!  

Now there are more wives coming to races.  Bjarne Riis has a little van for the wives if they want to follow the race.  They stay sometimes in the same hotel, but not in the same room with you.  But especially in a stage race, you just want to stay with your roommate and stay concentrated�  

PEZ: What do you think you�re going to miss the most about racing?  

Max:  The COMPETITION!  It�s real competition � trying to prove for yourself how good you are and to measure yourself with other people.  It�s like when you feel really really strong, and the condition is there � and there�s a little drag when the road goes up, and you can go really hard and you�re sweating, and you look behind and everybody is � BOOM !  dropping off!  I�m gonna miss that, yeah that�s something I�m gonna really miss�  

PEZ:  What is one of your favorite memories from racing, a day when you had a really great ride?  

Max:  Oh � when I was I a breakaway with Greg Lemond, and I won a stage in �90 or �91, at Savona in the Giro.  It was a rainy day, and there was 3 of us in the break, and the bunch was closing up on us.  And actually, the 3rd guy who was in the break � Coppolillo � he got caught.  And we started the sprint � me and Greg � and he got 2 meters at the beginning � he jumped really hard... And you know when you get out if the saddle when it�s raining, and your legs are so hard after a long day? � and I thought �fuck I�m not gonna get it�, but then I got onto his wheel - and then I started to get next to him � and then I won!  That was a great feeling that day.  

PEZ:  What was your favorite big Tour?  

Max:  I liked the Giro.  I think the Tour doesn�t have a lot of respect for the riders, it�s more the �whole business, but the single rider � they didn�t really have a lot of respect for us.  It�s just getting too much, too big�  

PEZ:  What about something you won�t miss so much?  

Max:  �I won�t missssss�  uh � some shitty races like 3 Days of de Panne in the cold rain.  Stuff like that I won�t miss�  

PEZ:  Will you stay involved in cycling in the future?  

Max:  Well I want to keep my doors open, that�s for sure.  I don�t know if I see myself as a directeur, but I really like to organize something for people from around the world, using Tuscany as a resource, you know something so special � Tuscany, food and bicycles, all put together.  That�s why I think your website and the internet is a very good vehicle for letting people know what I�d like to do� something different for couples, with things to do for wives who don�t cycle � shopping trips to Prada, a lesson in local cuisine�

  THE LAST SPRING  
PEZ:  You and I first met at the start line for the Tour of Flanders.  How were you feeling for the Classics this year?  

Max:  We had a training camp before Paris-Nice and Tirreno, and I was riding really really well, one of the best riders in the team.  We were timing ourselves up the hill, sand I was doing really well.  And then it happened that we didn�t do Tirreno.  Because we didn�t do the Giro this year � Castellano, the organizer � at the last moment said �CSC is not doing Tirrreno� � and I was on the program for Tirreno.  But for me, missing out on that race, at my age [37- ed.] I really needed a 7-8 day race.  I paid by not doing that race.  My form went down because I needed a stage race to finish off all the work I did in the winter.  You can train as much as you want, but you come to a certain point and you really need to put it into speed.  So I�d say all my Classics were really below how I was riding the 20 days before that.  

I love the Classics � Flanders, Roubaix � all of them.  I�d get especially motivated.  They�re the races what kept me going actually (for the last couple of years)�  

PEZ:  Okay � well thanks so much for talking to us - our readers are going to love this  - a great interview!  

Max:  No problem � just call me anytime� it was a pleasure!

                                  The good news on climate change is that the world wants to do something. The bad news is that none of these fine sentiments will matter unless a critical mass of countries unites around a real policy.  Delegates from around the world will meet next month in Bali, supposedly to launch negotiations on a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol. In this   Washington Post   op-ed,   Sebastian Mallaby   argues that while people agree that action is essential, they disagree so fiercely on the details that action may prove impossible.

				  The Dollar in Danger  
                	                						  Author:  Sebastian Mallaby  , Director of the Maurice R. Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies and Paul A. Volcker Senior Fellow for International Economics

                                  Since the breaking of the gold link, the dollar has become the world's primary measure of value.  But the dollar, like the gold standard before it, is under pressure. For the United States, a falling dollar means pricier imports but also an export boom that could carry the economy through its housing bust. Yet, for countries that use the euro, a weak dollar means a loss of competitiveness.  And for dollar-pegging Asian exporters, a falling dollar worsens the export boom that is overheating their economies. So the world faces a dilemma.   Sebastian Mallaby   argues that a long-term goal of an alternative global currency may be in order.

                                  As the presidential campaign heats up, Barack Obama has come out swinging against Hillary Clinton. In this   Washington Post   op-ed,   Sebastian Mallaby   writes that, alone among the Democratic candidates, Clinton has the honesty to insist that the case for war in Iraq was reasonable at the time - even if, with the benefit of hindsight, the invasion has proved disastrous. She is not running away from military power, even in a political climate that makes running attractive.  Likewise on Iran, Clinton is the only one to insist that sanctions are less a prelude to war than a means of forestalling it.  Mallaby claims that it is impressive and surprising that Clinton has risen above Bush hatred in forming her worldview.

                                  After the failed presidency of his predecessor, Robert Zoellick is off to a good start.  He has set himself up as an uncompromising booster- cutting interest rates on loans to middle-income countries to encourage them to borrow more and mobilizing money to increase assistance to the poorest.  Zoellick also recognizes that the World Bank can be used as a tool to manage the challenges presented by both globalization and rising powers such as China and India.  Sebastian Mallaby argues that the best shot at channeling the rising nations' power constructively is to reduce the political deficit in globalization- and Robert Zoellick is looking to do just that.

                                  President Bush is poised to veto a bill that would expand health care for poor children, despite the fact that the bill has bipartisan backing and two-thirds of the public say they like it.  Bush’s objection to Congress's proposal is that it represents ""an incremental step toward the goal of government-run health care.""  In this   Washington Post   op-ed, Sebastian Mallaby argues that some degree of government intervention in health care is both inevitable and desirable.

                                  Politicians are supposed to be the masters of persuasion, flattery and spin; technocrats just the opposite. In a review of   The Age of Turbulence  , Alan Greenspan’s new book, Sebastian Mallaby claims that Greenspan succeeded as much through charm as through his skills as an economist.

                                  With OPEC flexing its muscles, the United States needs to make energy security a priority once again. In this   Washington Post   op-ed, Sebastian Mallaby argues that the United States ought to be boosting cooperation with fellow oil-consuming nations, particularly China. He advocates a proposal by Samuel Berger to form a multilateral green energy fund, in which China might invest some of the huge wealth created by its trade surpluses.

                                  Foreign assistance is an industry in itself: Every year, governments and charities spend some $200 billion on projects in poor countries. Development Executive Group, founded by Raj Kumar seven years ago, aspires to bring Bloomberg efficiency to the development business.  In this Washington Post op-ed, Sebastian Mallaby claims that foreign assistance is ripe for a Bloomberg-style leap forward.

                                  The most vivid image amid last week's financial turmoil came from the nation's biggest mortgage lender, Countrywide Financial Corp. Scenes at Countrywide branches conjured those grainy black-and-white images of Depression-era bank runs. Fear has taken over, and sound institutions are suffering along with poorly managed ones. Sebastian Mallaby argues that markets are punishing Countrywide irrationally - and dozens of other basically sound companies are caught up in the maelstrom.

                                  The current subprime mortgage meltdown is part of a time-honored story.  Despite the fact that there is more pain to come in this shakeout, Sebastian Mallaby argues that the market for subprime mortgages will eventually revive and thrive, just as it did with subprime�s close cousin, the junk bond.

  This report, by International Affairs Fellow   Michelle D. Gavin   and sponsored by the   Center for Preventive Action  , surveys the current situation in Zimbabwe and proposes steps that can increase the likelihood that regime change, when it comes, will bring constructive reform instead of conflict and state collapse.

  Scientific Advisors  

  Clinton Howard  , Ph.D.   After graduating at Rice University in Biology and Chemistry, he did graduate work at Johns Hopkins Medical School, and completed a Master's Degree at Southwestern Medical School. With these on-campus studies, forty years of health care management, seven years of off-campus research papers, and a dissertation on Nanotechnolgy, he was awarded a Ph.D. from La Salle University. He served as the first President of the Irving Community Hospital, now Baylor Medical Center of Irving where an outpatient wing has been named ""The   Clinton Howard   Center for Health Management"". He was appointed one of six original members of the Texas Air Control Board that wrote regulations reducing air pollution in the state. He founded American Biomedical Corporation, the first network of medical laboratories in the US. He later founded Carrington Laboratories; the company that discovered the active healing ingredient in the aloe vera plant, and manufactured a line of wound care products. In 1991, he founded RBC Life Sciences, in order to manufacture a higher quality line of advanced nutritional supplements. In 1993 he was awarded ""The Distinguished Health Service Award"" by the Dallas Fort Worth Hospital Council, an organization of the 85 hospitals in North Texas.   

  Dr.   J. Lee Phelps  
  Dr.   J. Lee Phelps   earned a Ph.D. in Pharmacology at Columbia University and a Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) in Chemistry from the University of California. He was President of Austin Laboratories from 1981 to 1989 and Aneric Research Corporation from 1978 to 1981. He has had a distinguished 20 year career in the creation, formulation and manufacturing of health-related products for large companies in North America and Europe.    Dr. Phelps formulated and manufactured the original RBC products and then took a sabbatical for several years. Fortunately, he is back working with the RBC Team of Scientists to develop exciting new products for RBC as our Vice President of Science & Technology.  

  Albert Zehr  , Ph.D.  
  Dr.   Albert Zehr   co-founded the Pure Life company in Canada and developed high quality nutritional products. With a PhD in nutrition, Dr. Zehr has been formulating nutritional products for over 15 years. Dr. Zehr's passion for excellent products is only matched by his love of people. RBC Life Sciences acquired the Pure Life company in 1992 and is proud to have Dr. Albert Zehr as an emeritus member of our Scientific Advisory Team. Today he devotes most of his time as a missionary and lay minister. Dr. Zehr is the author of two excellent books in the field of nutrition:   Healthy Steps and Help Yourself Healthcare  .   

  Leonard Smith  , M.D.  
  Dr. Smith received his Medical Degree from the University of Florida College of Medicine in 1969 and teaches there as Courtesy Professor in the Department of Medicine. He has practiced as a General and Vascular Surgeon since 1980. Dr. Smith is a member of several professional organizations including the American College for the Advancement of Medicine, American College of Surgeons, and the American Preventive Medical Association. He has made a life long study of the pharmacology of natural supplements, and has used an holistic approach to patient care during his entire career. He is an expert consultant on supplement formulations, and is a sought-after lecturer on Alternative or Complimentary Medicine, Diet, Nutrition, and Stress Management. As a Scientific Advisor to RBC, Dr. Smith has contributed to the development of a number of RBC products.  

   Dr. Debi Drake has a diverse background with medical residencies in Emergency medicine in Boston, San Francisco, and Detroit and numerous staff appointments in Ontario, Canada. For the past ten years she has actively pursued a private practice in Family and Preventative Medicine. During her college career, she was recognized numerous times with scholarships for outstanding achievements while earning a Bachelor of Science degree at McMaster University. She was later certified in Family Medicine and Emergency Medicine at the University of Toronto.   Dr. Drake has written a book called   The Fundamentals of Living Well  , and she has become a popular lecturer and guest on both radio and TV shows. In 1987, she founded the Cirquet Foundation for personal development, which is committed to creative, holistic, preventative health education. She is currently using RBC products in her practice with great success.  

  Kimberly Purdy Lloyd  , M.S.  
  Kimberly Purdy Lloyd   received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1975. She received a Masters of Science degree from the University of North Texas at Denton in 1979. Kimberly worked as a research associate in basic research at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Dallas in Immunology during and after her education. She was granted the Welch Scholarship for her graduate work in biochemistry with an emphasis in enzymology and immunology. Kimberly has published and presented numerous papers. She received a first place award with the American Chemical Society in 1976. Her thesis work was published in the Archives or Biochemistry and Biophysics, Purdy et al, 1979.

              About Me  
              My name is   Tom Fritsch  . I'm a consultant at AdOn Network in Phoenix.   

I've computerized laser labs at Bell Labs, worked as an analyst at   Goldman Sachs  , co founded humornetwork.com, brokered ad deals in NYC for years then witnessed 911 and now find myself in sunny Phoenix in a web 2.0 world selling targeted traffic and interstitials in volume for AdOnNetwork.com   

Our international network serves 4 Billion impressions and reaches 115 Million Unique Visitors each month.   

Online ROI tracking lets you see which traffic sources perform and eliminate the ones that don't. If you don't want to manage all this information you will have me to optimize your target keywords and minimize your Cost Per Acquisition (CPA).You can set daily and monthly spending caps to minimize your risk.   

We can drive volume traffic to help monetize the ads on your site.   

We make it very easy to test with no contracts and reasonable daily minimum spending.   

Detailed advertiser information is found here http://corporate.adonnetwork.com/public/advertiser_resources.jsp   

I would like to chat about advertising strategies and see if we can work together.   
Please reply with a good time to talk or just call me   

Thanks.   
Tom

  Railroad Retirement reform   became law Jan. 1, 2002  

  Efforts by a coalition of labor and management to modernize Railroad Retirement were rewarded in December when President Bush signed the historic reform measure into law.  
  The Senate approved the legislation by a vote of 90-9 on Dec. 5. According to congressional procedures, the bill was returned to the House because the Senate passed the legislation under a different bill number from that originally passed by the House last July. The House passed the bill 369-33 on Dec. 11. The legislation was signed by President Bush on Dec. 21 and became law Jan. 1, 2002.  
  ""Modernization of the Railroad Retirement system promises benefits for the rail industry, Norfolk Southern, our people, family members and retirees,"" said   David R. Goode  , chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""That's why reform enjoyed such broad support.  
  ""However, translating that support to favorable votes in Congress didn't happen without a lot of hard work,"" Goode said. ""It took the sustained efforts of both rail labor and rail management, whose combined efforts showed the power of what we can accomplish by working together.""  
  The legislation provides a more secure retirement for rail workers, retirees and their spouses. Key provisions include improvements to surviving spouse benefits, full retirement annuity at age 60 with 30 years of service, elimination of artificial caps on benefits, vesting after five years instead of 10 and requiring carriers to insure future fund solvency with tax increases if necessary. Associated with the bill, but not part of it, is a provision to allow some private investment of Railroad Retirement funds.  
  ""The efforts of many people working together to modernize the Railroad Retirement system made passage of these bills possible,"" said   Jim Hixon  , senior vice president administration. ""Thanks especially go to everyone who contacted their senators and members of Congress to urge their support.  
  ""We are extremely pleased that so many senators and representatives saw the wisdom of reforming our retirement system, and that the president agreed and moved to enact the legislation quickly,"" Hixon said. ""Now, railroad employees and their families can be assured of a stronger Railroad Retirement system, and a more secure future.""  

  Planned 2002 capital spending announced  
  Norfolk Southern plans to spend $705 million for capital improvements in 2002.  
  ""We have completed many of our major investments in line capacity, rail terminals and information systems in 2001, which has enabled us to increase the resources devoted to maintaining our rail infrastructure,"" said   David R. Goode  , chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""We are continuing our solid commitment to safety and service during challenging economic times with spending levels designed to keep our system strong and our service steadily improving.""  
  The anticipated spending includes $482 million for roadway projects and $173 million for equipment.  
  In roadway improvements, the largest expenditure will be $366 million for rail, crosstie, ballast and bridge programs. In addition, $31 million is provided for communications, signal and electrical projects and $17 million for environmental projects and public improvements such as grade crossing separations and crossing signal upgrades.  
  Other roadway projects include $43 million for marketing and industrial development initiatives, including increasing track capacity and access to coal receivers and vehicle production and distribution facilities, and continuing investments in intermodal infrastructure.  
  Equipment spending includes $102 million to purchase 50 six-axle locomotives and upgrade existing locomotives. Equipment spending also includes $57 million for projects related to computers and information technology, including allocations for additional security and backup systems. ""Our equipment spending, which is lower than in previous years, reflects improved fleet management and asset utilization,"" Goode said.  

  Railroads challenge harmful   W.Va. court practice  
  Three eastern railroads filed suit to stop West Virginia's ""mass litigation"" process, which unfairly benefits out-of-state plaintiffs and their attorneys at the expense of the state's citizens and businesses.   
  Norfolk Southern Railway, CSX Transportation and Conrail, joined by American Premier Underwriters (formerly Penn Central), filed suit in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia against the justices of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. The railroads seek to invalidate West Virginia Trial Court Rule (TCR) 26.01, which in 1999 established a ""Mass Litigation Panel and Procedure"" to consolidate asbestos-related civil cases against railroads and other parties.   
  The railroads said TCR 26.01 deprives them of due process of law provided for in the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, because in lumping together plaintiffs who worked at numerous different locations, in various jobs, during different times, with diverse mitigating factors and alleged exposures and injuries, the process will deprive the defendants of a fair trial.   
  Consolidation of cases, in effect, pressures railroads into settling them, rather than proceeding to trial and risking enormous verdicts skewed toward the most seriously injured plaintiffs while less injured (and even uninjured) plaintiffs obtain windfall verdicts. Further, West Virginia effectively provides no right to appeal such verdicts; the only appeals court in the state generally refuses to consider a railroad's appeal of a verdict, the railroads said.   
  Of the 33,100 civil lawsuits of all types pending in West Virginia courts, more than 25,000 or 75 percent are asbestos-related. Of the 9,000 asbestos cases pending nationwide against the three railroads, 5,150 or 57 percent are before West Virginia courts. In those 5,150 cases, 4,440 plaintiffs are people who do not work, live or pay taxes in West Virginia. More than 4,800 of the plaintiffs in these cases are represented by a single Pennsylvania law firm.   

  Duty.Honor.Country:
Car inspector serves nation 
in Operation Enduring Freedom  
  Roger Gregg   was working as a freight car inspector at Sevier Yard in Knoxville, Tenn., when he received a call that his services as a U.S. Navy Reserve criminal investigator were needed. Gregg was called to duty in January 2001 to join the investigation into the attack on the U.S.S. Cole in October 2000.  
  When terrorists attacked the World Trade Center and Pentagon on Sept. 11, Gregg's duty was extended, and he now serves under Operation Enduring Freedom.  
  Gregg joined Southern Railway in 1976. He previously had served in the U.S. Navy and re-upped in 1984 after a 12-year break. Today, he serves as a chief petty officer stationed in Washington, D.C. He is division officer of the Antiterrorism Alert Center, an administrative officer and a relief senior enlisted advisor.  
  ""When I reported for duty in January 2001, I had more than a million information security clearances due,"" he said. ""Things didn't get much better when September rolled around.""  
  Gregg works in the Washington Navy Yard, which is eight blocks from the Capitol and right across the river from the Pentagon. He was near the turmoil on Sept. 11.   
  ""I could see the Pentagon burning from my office window,"" he said.  
  Gregg's extended duty ends in March 2002, when he expects to resume his railroad career.  

  NS, Heart of Georgia Railroad team up   to help pave way to success  
  When the Douglas Asphalt Company was awarded a contract to construct a 24-mile stretch of Interstate 75 between Cordele and Tifton, Ga., it required a convenient, competitively priced way to transport aggregates to a hot-mix site near the construction area. The company preferred to receive the materials by rail, but the proposed site was not rail-served.  
  The project called for at least 400,000 tons of clean granite to move from Martin Marietta's quarry in Ruby, Ga., to Cordele.  
  ""We wanted to secure this business with a truck-competitive price,"" said Norfolk Southern National Account Manager   Steve Marshall  .   

NS and HOG teamed up to provide a rail-served site for Douglas Asphalt Company's hot-mix site.  
  ""We had a site that would have been convenient for Douglas, but it required construction of a siding and installation of a switch on our main line. That affected our ability to quote a truck-competitive rate,"" said   Paul Heymann  , NS product manager, construction.   
  ""We continued to work with Douglas Asphalt, because this business is important to NS,"" said   Jason Reiner  , NS manager industrial development. ""The asphalt company was leaning toward truck as its means of transportation, when the Heart of Georgia Railroad (HOG), an NS short line railroad partner, suggested an alternative.""  
  HOG showed Douglas representatives a few sites that would serve the needs of the asphalt company. HOG had a site that would accommodate the plant and provide storage for aggregate stockpiles, but it needed some improvements. The existing 1,300-foot siding had to be extended to1,600 feet, and there was some concern about using two rail carriers for the 60-mile move.  
  NS and HOG were able to provide assurance of consistent service and truck-competitive pricing. Douglas and HOG partnered to make the improvements. However, a few more challenges still faced the project.   
  Leasing and zoning issues had to be settled before construction of the plant could begin. Working with local and state agencies, the issues were settled, and Douglas began operations in August 2001.  
  ""At times, we believed we were the least likely candidate to get this business,"" said Brad Lafevres, HOG's president and chief executive officer. ""Working together, we were able to put this business on the rail, not on the highway, and we all have a satisfied customer.""  
  For its efforts, Heart of Georgia, based in Americus, Ga., won the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association's 2001 Marketing Award in the ""Small Railroad Factor"" category.

						  Lawrence N. Gang, lawyer, 1954-2007  

  Vail, CO Colorado  

						  July 25, 2007  Comments  

						     Print        Email  

  Lawrence �Larry� N. Gang, a lawyer for Vail Resorts, died July 6. He was 53.  Gang was born Jan. 20, 1954, in Huntington, W.V. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1972, received his B.A. from the University of North Carolina and his J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.   A member of the bars of Colorado, Missouri, Ohio and Maryland, Larry practiced law in the general counsel�s office of numerous corporations, most recently Vail Resorts, Inc.  First introduced to the Rockies on a family vacation, the Gangs relocated from Missouri to Colorado in 2004 to be closer to the mountains. Initially settling in Breckenridge, Larry became an avid hiker and snowshoer.   He recently took up downhill skiing in an attempt to keep up with his sons, Adam and Christopher, both expert and fearless downhill skiers.   Larry was proud of both the academic and athletic accomplishments of his boys and often spoke of what fine young men they were becoming. He attributed much of their success to the love and guidance provided by his wife, Eileen. Throughout their life together, Eileen�s love and support were a source of strength and happiness for Larry.  Larry and his family were avid baseball, football and basketball fans, particularly loyal to the St. Louis Cardinals. However, Larry�s favorite teams were undoubtedly the soccer, baseball and basketball teams on which his sons played and for whom he coached.  Larry had reached 13 summits in excess of 14,000 feet, known as fourteeners. He often hiked the mountains alone, preferring to travel at his own pace. Recently, he set out to add another fourteener to his list and sadly never returned.  Gang is survived by his wife, Eileen, of 23 years; twin sons Adam and Christopher, both 14; brothers and sisters-in-law David and Roberta Gang of Longmeadow, Mass., and Robert and Adrienne Gang of Miami, Fla.; nephews Alex, Jonathan, Nick and Taylor; and niece Barclay.  A memorial service will be held at a later date.   The family has established a trust fund for the benefit of the children�s education. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the trust fund in the following manner: Adam and Christopher Gang Education Trust, c/o Fidelity Investments, P.O. Box 5000, Cincinnati, OH 45273-8007.

  John Parkes  

  www.nhsexpose.co.uk  

  John Parkes    Chief Executive West Suffolk NHS
Trust Formerly St
George's Healthcare Deputy Chief Executive   

  (See Section In Red At
Bottom Of This Page For My Comments Following My Receipt Of The Sissling
Internal NHS Report, Which Found That My Allegation That   John Parkes   deliberately
and improperly altered the cancelled operations figures at St George's was well
founded)  

  John Parkes   the Deputy Chief
    Executive did not play any active part in my NHS Internal Disciplinary
process.  By the time I was asked to resign my post of Finance Director
with St George's Healthcare NHS Trust he had already moved on to become Chief
Executive of West Suffolk NHS Trust.  Although he played no part in my
disciplinary he played the central role in the cancelled operations issue which
I believe was the catalyst for the Trust starting to decide they needed to get
rid of me because as they say I was not a ""team player"".  John
Parkes reputation amongst the staff that worked within the Information section
of my directorate was not good.  He had previously managed these staff
before the responsibility for managing the information function had been
transferred to me.  Early in 2001 I had a complaint from a senior female
member of the team that when she and a female business manager had attended a
meeting with Mr Parkes to talk about issues concerning the Outpatient Partial
Booking system, that he had been both aggressive and confrontational and had used
inappropriate obscene language during the course of what she had considered to
be a very unprofessional meeting.   When   Wendy
McCarthy   reported that   Kelly
Goulding    had complained that   John Parkes   had told her to alter the
cancelled operations figures because of the complaint I had previously received
about John Parkes, it was a matter that I took very seriously and why I   reported
it to the Chief Executive Ian Hamilton  .   In the week following my
disclosure of the cancelled operations issue,   John Parkes   telephoned me to
complain that I had backed Kelly Goulding in her reporting of the cancelled
operations issue. ""How can I trust you as a board colleague if I don't know
what you are going to say in this kind of situation"", he told me.  I
replied that he would always know what I was going to say in any given
situation, because I was always going to tell the truth regardless of the
respective seniority of the individuals concerned.  The conversation ended
acrimoniously, but the fact that it took place was confirmed when my secretary   Janet
Watson gave her evidence under oath   to the Employment Tribunal.  
Subsequent to my raising of the cancelled operations issue,   John Parkes   tried
to suggest that the reason why he had told Kelly Goulding to alter the cancelled
operations figures was because there was some confusion about
    how to define a cancellation, but I clarified that the Information
    Directorate was using the correct definition with Aisling Bowman of the
    London Regional Office of the NHS and of course John Parkes only raised this
issue following my disclosure and as the   statement
of Kelly Gouldng   shows, no mention of a definition was raised when she was
told to change the figures.  Indeed the Trust seems to have been quite
imaginative in coming up with excuses for why the numbers were altered, as when
the issue first broke in the media they suggested in was nothing to do with
definitions, but was because of a computer glitch. Check out what the Trust said
to the   Evening
Standard in January 2003   ,   the
BBC   or the   Guardian  . 
This was an excuse they abandoned at the Employment Tribunal when the Trust
said, that they now admitted that I had flagged the issue up correctly as a
protected disclosure, but that
it had been satisfactorily dealt with and it was not the reason why they had
dismissed me from my post.     Sir Nigel
Crisp   of course had said publicly that NHS managers who fiddle hospital
figures will have to leave the service and will not be re-employed
elsewhere.    John Parkes   has been promoted to the post of Chief
Executive at West Suffolk NHS Trust.  I leave you to decide whether you
think this is a reasonable thing to have happened.  

  As a post
script to this issue following the   BBC Panoroma programme  
I received a    letter from a firm of solicitors Capsticks
   that said
that if I repeated those comments the West Suffolk NHS Trust would take
legal action against me to protect   John Parkes   reputation.  As I am quite
sure such legal action would fail as I have done nothing but tell the truth I
sent a   very robust reply   back to Capsticks
and no action has ever been initiated against me by the West Suffolk NHS
Trust.  However, in my reply I asked how the West Suffolk Trust could pay
for any legal action that Mr Parkes proposed taking, when the issue related to
something that happened when we were both working for St George's
Healthcare.  I would have thought as tax payers money was involved and I
have to make my own arrangements to cover my own legal costs, it was a reasonable question to ask, but as is
usual
with the ""open"" NHS they have declined to answer my question as their   reply  
makes clear.  

  UPDATE:
On the   12th
November the London Evening Standard   published an article which showed
further information on the misreporting of government targets.  This wrong
doing was based around   an e-mail that John
Parkes had sent   to both myself and the Chief Executive in February 2001,
where in response to an e-mail from me expressing concern about the misreporting
of outpatient waiting list figures he makes it crystal clear that reporting
these figures is not as one would have imagined a straightforward process, but
is one that has a political dimension which he is handling with the   London
Regional Office of the NHS   .  What happened at St George's was that for
a period the outpatient waiting list figures were under reported.  However,
when the mistake was discovered, the action that   John Parkes   took in
consultation with the   London Regional Office  ,
was not as the public should have been entitled to expect an immediate honest
admission that the numbers had been understated but was instead an attempt to
consider deliberately misreporting the figures over a period of time to try and
ensure that no one ever became aware of the under reporting.  The Evening
Standard article attributes   John Parkes   as saying in relation to this issue,
""In subsequent e-mails I made it crystal clear that neither the Trust nor I
would support any return that misrepresented reality"".  I would simply
ask anyone reading that statement to compare it with   Kelly
Goulding's statement   of St George's Information about  

   what   John Parkes   said
to her in October 2001 about   cancelled
operations  .  The   Wandsworth
Borough News in their 14th November edition   covered this story and asked
  John Parkes   to comment on this issue, but he declined to do so.  

  It is
probably wise that   John Parkes   and Capsticks did not pursue their threatened
legal action regarding their claim that statements that I made on the Panorama
programme fiddling the figures were untrue.  On Tuesday 19th October 2004
the NHS Internal Investigation chaired by David Sissling reported and stated:-  

     ""I consider Mr Perkin's allegations
proven, in respect of the inappropriate alteration of cancelled operations data
for the three weeks commencing 24 September 2001.  I am also of the opinion
that the Trust was wrong in offering a variety of excuses for the error
occurring"".  

  Are the NHS
going to sack Mr Parkes from his job of Chief Executive for fiddling the
cancelled operations, as Sir Nigel Crisp  and the Secretary of State of
Health have always maintained will be the case where it is found that senior NHS
officials have falsely changed reported clinical data?  Of course they have
not.  The NHS is much happier sacking ""Whistle-blowers"" like
myself.  The South West London Strategic Health Authority who have
published the report, have not recommended that any action be taken in regard to
Mr Parkes even though the NHS has found my allegations to be proven.

Former Middle Tennessee standout   Laura Miguez  -Howarth   begins her first season on the Blue Raider soccer staff as a graduate assistant. Miguez-Howarth, who is regarded as the best all-around players in program history, completed her eligibility in 2004 and earned her Bachelor's Degree in 2005.      
Her familiarity with the program, the current staff, as well as several of the upperclassmen, enables Miguez-Howarth to provide cohesiveness to the staff. She is involved in various aspects of the program, from player development to on-field training.      
Miguez-Howarth starred for the Blue Raiders from 2001-04 and departed as the program as one of its most decorated players ever. She served as one of the captains on Middle Tennessee's 2004 Sun Belt Conference championship team - the first in program history - and helped lead to the Blue Raiders to a school-record 13 wins in the process.      
While winning always was foremost with the talented forward from Dallas, Texas, she accomplished many milestones and received numerous accolades throughout her career. Miguez-Howarth was named to the All-Time Sun Belt Conference Soccer Team in conjunction with the league's 30-year anniversary in 2005 and she is the only three-time All-Sun Belt Conference selection (2002, 2003, 2004) in Middle Tennessee history.      
Miguez-Howarth is Middle Tennessee's all-time leader in points (87) and assists (31), and she is tied for the career lead in goals (28). During her remarkable four-year career, Miguez-Howarth set three individual career marks and was part of teams that currently own the single-season records for wins, shots, goals, assists and points. She also is the holder of numerous single-season and single-game records, while appearing on the Top 10 list in every offensive category for a single-game, single-season or career.      
Miguez-Howarth married former Middle Tennessee baseball standout Jason Howarth during the summer of 2006. They reside in Murfreesboro.

  Bits&Bytes: HyperActive Technologies raises $6.5 million  

  Saturday, May 27, 2006  

  By Corilyn Shropshire  , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  

  HyperActive Technologies said yesterday it has raised $6.5 million from private investors convened by Spencer Trask Ventures, a New York-based private equity firm.  

  Joe Porfeli  ,   chief executive officer of the North Side-based company, said the investment would pay for sales, marketing and business development activities to expand HyperActive's customer base. Hyperactive develops computers used to make fast-food restaurants more efficient.  

  Vice President of Clinical Development and Regulatory Affairs   Lisa Parr   left the Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse this week for a new job at an undisclosed California pharmaceuticals firm, Greenhouse officials said yesterday.  

  At the Greenhouse, Dr. Parr shared her expertise in the clinical trials and regulatory processes with local biotech startups. She joined the Greenhouse from Allergan Inc. and also has worked at a number of other pharmaceutical firms, including Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Academic Pharmaceuticals.  

  Dr. Parr's departure came a day after the Greenhouse announcement that Chief Operating Officer   David Palmer   would leave on July 1 to head North Side-based biotech startup ClearCount Medical Solutions.  

  For at least two months, the Greenhouse has been ""actively looking"" for new executives-in-residence with expertise in therapeutics and diagnostics, Mr. Palmer said.  

  Two executives-in-residence remain at the greenhouse,   James Jordan   and   Alan West  . Former part-time executives-in-residence   Dennis Metheny   and   Bernard Cambou   left the Greenhouse earlier this year. Dr. Cambou is now the chief executive officer of StageMark Inc. while Mr. Metheny heads his own consulting firm, TeeMyn LLC.  

  Since its inception, the Greenhouse has had 10 executives-in-residence -- seasoned life science industry executives who lend their know-how to assist startup firms with such tasks as fund-raising and product development. Nine of the 10 former executives still are active with local life science firms, and six still live in the region, according to Mr. Palmer.  

  There's no word on who is in the running to replace Mr. Palmer, known locally as the Greenhouse's ""go-to"" guy.  

  ""My intent was to always go back to the private sector,"" Mr. Palmer said.  

  He chose ClearCount because he was impressed with the management team, including co-founders   Steve Fleck   and   Gautam Gandhi   and ClearCount's board, which includes biotech veteran and Carnegie Mellon University Professor   Art Boni   and Mr. Metheny, who has led two local biotech firms, Respironics Inc. and TissueInformatics Inc.  

  Plus, Mr. Palmer added, there was little risk in bringing to market Clear Count's maiden product, a medical device aid that tracks surgical instruments using radio frequency identification technology.  

  Mr. Palmer wouldn't get into the details of his plans upon taking over at Clear Count, only that he will be guiding the firm through the regulatory process, fund-raising and fine-tuning its go-to-market strategy.  

  Lawrenceville-based robotics firm RE2 said it joined forces with another Pittsburgh robotics-focused software maker, Oakland-based CoroWare Labs. The firms are developing a software kit designed to assist robot developers building unmanned ground vehicles for the U.S. Department of Defense to meet common design specifications.  

  Local technology firms II-VI Inc. and Ansoft Corp. made BusinessWeek magazine's Hot 100 ""sizzling companies to watch"" list. Published this week, the list highlights firms the magazine has labeled ""strong, agile and fiercely competitive.""  

  South Side-based electronics design software maker Ansoft was ranked 46th and II-VI, the Saxonburg-based maker of lasers and optical equipment, ranked 97th. Both have posted profits that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and have experienced record-setting growth spurts.

  2nd Century  

  Charlotte Baker  , Senior Vice President Marketing , and co-founder   

  Why would small businesses want to work with 2  nd   Century?  

  Most small businesses are at a disadvantage when it comes to communications because
they dont have the necessary capital to invest in equipment and they cant
afford an IT staff to maintain their communications network. These businesses have to
juggle multiple vendors to get a complete solution. Worst of all, these businesses have to
compete with bigger companies that use technology to their advantage.   

  2  nd   Centurys solution relieves the small business customer from the
total cost of owning and maintaining their voice and data infrastructures while e-enabling
them to operate effectively in todays internetworked economy. These customers no
longer need to invest in separate networks, separate pieces of equipment, separate
telecommunications providers, and a technical support staff. With our solution, customers
benefit from high-quality voice services and high-speed Internet access, plus applications
and remote LAN monitoring that reaches all the way to the Network Interface Card. Since 2  nd  
Centurys network extends to the customers premises there is no capital outlay
required for equipment. Customers can add new services one at a time and 2  nd  
Century will upgrade the equipment and software as necessary. Best of all, customers are
now free to focus on running their business and compete with a technological advantage.  

  What about their traditional VAR?  

  2  nd   Century peacefully co-exists and supports existing VARs such as LAN
system integrators and interconnects. In fact, 2  nd   Century does not directly
compete with them. Through a strategic alliance with 2  nd   Century channel
partners benefit from a robust partnership program and add a fully integrated
communications solution to their product suite allowing them to upsell current customers
and approach new ones with a ""one-stop-shop"" offering. Best of all, channel
partners also earn a recurring revenue stream. 2  nd   Century also provides
certified channel partners resources and benefits such as:   

        A local 2  nd   Century sales and service staff   
        A world-class 24 x 7 end-customer support center  
        Customer leads sharing programs  
        A certified training program   
        Stronger positioning with potential customers  
        Co-op marketing and advertising support  

  What about working with internal IT consultants  ?  

  When a small business has an internal IT staff, 2  nd   Centurys remote
monitoring capabilities act as a supplement. Through our 24 x 7 network monitoring and
support, 2  nd   Century can proactively detect network problems and can assist
with troubleshooting.  

  What type of small business is the typical or target small business?  

  We focus exclusively on the small and medium business market  what we define as
companies with 10-250 employees.   

  What should a small business look for in a ""new"" technology provider or are
they basically all the same?  

  All service providers are not the same. Some offer transport services such as voice
and/or data and others offer web services. Some offer applications and some provide
desktop support. Very few offer unified services across all of these areas. Small
businesses should look for a service provider that understands the power of the Internet
and its use as a competitive advantage. A partner with this knowledge can help introduce
the small business to new tools that will help their business grow.  

  Small businesses should also look for a technology provider that requires a minimal
capital investment from the customer. This preserves capital for other business expenses.
A small business should also look for maximum bandwidth flexibility so that the bandwidth
can be dynamically allocated between voice and data as needed. These companies should look
for service guarantees customizable by desktop. Finally, a small business should look for
one neck to choke. (Not that they would need one with us   J   )

  Here's some background about 2C@..  

  2  nd   Century Communications  

  Bringing the Next-Generation of Communications and Desktop Computing  

  to Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses  

  Corporate Backgrounder  

  Founded in 1998, 2  nd   Century Communications provides small and medium-sized
businesses with an integrated package of advanced computing applications plus voice and
data solutions delivered over a unified network. The next-generation carrier rolled out
its data-based local exchange network in 11 cities during the fourth quarter of 1999 and
plans to expand nationwide to 30 markets by the end of 2000. The company will eventually
be in 48 cities across the country.  

  The Nation's First e.LEC  

  2  nd   Century Communications is the nation's first e.LEC, with the
""e"" representing the companys ""e-communications"" strategy.
Whether its e-mail, a Web presence or e-commerce solutions, 2  nd   Century
provides the essential tools for businesses to stay connected in the rapidly-evolving
internetworked economy. Using next-generation data-based technology, 2  nd  
Century delivers all of these ""e-communications"" services --plus the traditional
local and long distance services and high-speed Internet access -- via a single,
easy-to-use network. 2  nd   Century is a complete communications partner offering
the services traditionally provided separately by Interconnects, Integrators, ILECs, IXCs,
ISPs, CLECs, and ASPs.   

  Small and Medium-Sized Business Focus  

  2  nd   Century recognizes the unique needs of small- and medium-sized
businesses (defined as having 10 to 250 employees). Currently, most of these businesses
use multiple vendors and incur multiple bills for local, long distance, Internet access,
computer equipment, wiring, telephones and maintenance contracts. These business owners
are frustrated with poor customer service, confusing bills and the hassle of dial-up
Internet access. With 2  nd   Centurys solution, small- and medium-sized
businesses no longer need to invest in separate networks, separate pieces of equipment,
separate telecommunications providers, and a technical support staff.  

  As an IT partner, 2  nd   Century empowers these businesses to compete in the
marketplace by equipping them with innovative technology solutions that relieve them of
the burden of managing their telecommunications and networking infrastructures. Providing
an outsourced solution that extends from the network all the way to the desktop, 2  nd  
Century enables customers to realize a  greater return on their total IT investment
and reduce the cost of owning and maintaining their communications infrastructure. 2  nd  
Century allows customers to concentrate on their core business operations while, at the
same time, minimizing capital expenditures and other investments in time and resources.
Most importantly, 2  nd   Century provides the solutions that empower small- and
medium-sized businesses to compete on-par with their larger rivals.  

  Pioneering Approach to Technology  

  In August 1999, 2  nd   Century completed the first-ever voice call between an
ATM-based local exchange network and the public switched telephone network (PSTN). This
accomplishment enabled 2  nd   Century to cost-effectively deploy a converged
network for voice and data services. Building upon their pioneering development efforts in
data-based telephony (DBT), the companys service is based on a single circuit, a
single protocol and a single switching fabric that can route and transport telephony
services such as voice, data, Internet and video.   

  Other providers such as Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs) and traditional
circuit-based CLECs require separate, dedicated networks for each service they provide,
often requiring the installation of five separate networks to the customer premises --
five separate networks   vs  . 2  nd   Centurys unified network.   

  2  nd   Centurys Network Differentiators  

    Network costs are 1/10  th   that of a circuit-based service provider with
  2/3rds of the capital being success-based deployed when a customer is turned up.  
    Offers remote desktop monitoring all the way to the Network Interface Card and service
  level agreements that can vary by desktop.  
    Delivers the same voice quality as the public switched telephone network (PSTN) while
  simultaneously offering high-speed data over the same line.   
    Customer premises equipment provided by 2  nd   Century with no capital outlay
  or monthly fee required by the customer. Customers add services one at a time and 2  nd  
  Century adds the necessary hardware, software and networking equipment.  
    Offers scalability and flexibility, such as ""burstable"" bandwidth (bandwidth
  on demand) for both voice and data.  

  Signature Offering - ESL Pro  SM  

  Launched in January 2000, 2  nd   Century introduces its premier offering, ESL
Pro, which converges communications and computing solutions into one package. ESL Pro
offers dedicated, high-speed Internet access and local and long distance services as well
as ""e-communications"" applications including e-mail, Web hosting, a firewall,
file sharing, and remote desktop and LAN monitoring. Future solutions will include
advanced data and telephony applications to the desktop, outsourced IT services and
distributed software applications along with service level agreements that can be
customized by desktop depending on an end users needs.  

  Market Evolution  

  The first century of communications belonged to Alexander Graham Bell and circuit-based
telephony. Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs), the original telephone companies,
had a telecommunications monopoly until the Telecommunications Act of 1996, when
Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLECs) emerged as alternate, competitive providers of
traditional voice and data communications. These first-generation CLECs modeled their
networks after the ILECs and ended up at a cost disadvantage due to economies of scale.   

  With data-based technology 2  nd   Century achieves a cost advantage over its
first generation competitors and is able to more efficiently reach the underserved small
and medium business segment. 2  nd   Century realizes the next century will
revolutionize the way small and medium businesses communicate in this internetworked
economy. The company chose its name, 2  nd   Century, because it believes it will
lead the charge by providing advanced mission-critical applications, fully integrated with
the traditional voice and data services, to small- and medium-sized businesses.  

  Sales and Service Strategy  

  2  nd   Century works with channel partners such as interconnect companies and
LAN system integrators who have established relationships with small- and medium-sized
businesses. 2  nd   Century has developed Web-based applications, which allow its
partners to procure telecommunications services via the Web. For rapid field deployment, 2  nd  
Century uses Lucent Technologies     NetCare� to provide
nationwide installation and 24-hour-a-day maintenance.   

  Management Team   

  2  nd   Centurys management team     has     extensive
experience at first-generation CLECs, competitive access providers, wireless companies,
incumbents and long distance carriers. The team includes:  

    John Prisco  , president and CEO  
    Charlotte Baker  , senior vice president, marketing and co-founder  
    Vince Rocca  , chief technology officer and co-founder  
    Robert Callahan  , vice president, information technology and chief information officer  
    Eric Vaughn  , vice president, electronic commerce  
    Mark Damico  , vice president, business operations  
    James Thomas  , vice president, human resources  
    Diane Gongaware  , regional president, northeast  
    Steve Markiewicz  , regional president, southeast  
    Joe Woods  , regional president, central  
    Joe Herman  , vice president, product management

  [quote]Brand Hypocrisy at Starbucks by   Douglas B. Holt

  Efforts by the Ethiopian coffee sector to trademark Ethiopia's most valuable coffee brands have come to a screeching halt, courtesy of The Starbucks Corporation. The coffee sector is pursuing trademarks in all major international markets on Sidamo, Yirgecheffe, and Harrar so that they can then apply sound marketing techniques to increase the commercial value of these brands. The goal is to significantly raise the incomes of many of the 15 million Ethiopians who are dependent on the coffee trade. Given that Ethiopia ranks amongst the poorest countries in the world�some 80% of its citizens live on less than $2 a day�this innovative and self-reliant effort to enhance the value of Ethiopia's commerce should be receiving unanimous cheers worldwide.

  Instead, Starbucks has worked with its industry lobbyists to pressure the US Patent and Trademark Office to turn down Ethiopia's trademark applications. As a result, the Office has refused to approve two of the three trademarks. And Starbucks has snubbed all attempts by Ethiopian officials to broker an acceptable agreement. Now that Oxfam has taken up Ethiopia's cause in a new media campaign, generating some 70,000 complaints so far, Starbucks has launched a media counter-offensive, publicly scolding Ethiopia's efforts. Even The Economist, that avowed champion of commerce, has taken Starbucks side to help squash this incipient effort to generate economic value. What gives?

  In my view, these actions by Starbucks management are not only deeply hypocritical. Ironically, they also pose a serious threat to Starbucks' brand equity. To unpack why this is so, we need first to understand the key role played by these Ethiopian brands in Starbucks' extraordinary success.

  Starbucks Relies on Ethiopian Coffee Brands

  What distinguishes Starbucks products from the many thousands of other coffee products on the market is powerful brand symbolism. Through its coffees, packaging, store design, baristas, Italian-icized lexicon, and music, Starbucks promotes a very accessible highbrow worldview that has had wide appeal amongst its college-educated ""creative class"" target. Starbucks invites customers to join its ""cosmopolitan connoisseur"" culture, which can be yours simply by grabbing a latte at your nearby Starbucks.

  One of the most important techniques Starbucks uses to develop this cosmopolitan connoisseur symbolism is the promotion of its coffees as artisanal products. All Starbucks coffees are named, packaged, and promoted to imbue them with the aura of traditional local craft, exotic coffees produced by peoples far removed from modern life in the North. The leading coffee brands from Ethiopia�Sidamo, Harrar, and Yirgacheffe�have played a starring role in allowing Starbucks to claim these artisanal and exotic qualities.

  Starbucks markets coffees in a manner very similar to the marketing of fine wines: writing flowery prose about terrior characteristics and idiosyncratic artisanal processes steeped in local traditions. From the Starbucks Website:

  From the birthplace of coffee, Sidamo is highly prized by coffee buyers from around the world. It features a fleeting, floral aroma with a bright yet soft finish and, like the best Sidamo coffees, a wonderful hint of lemon.

  Each coffee is presented as a product of artistry and tradition, alive with ""native"" folk culture far removed from the lifeways of Starbucks customers. Starbucks trades on the fact that Ethiopian producers are not commercially minded multinationals, but, rather, simple peasants who exist outside the capitalist marketplace:

  Typically, Ethiopian coffee is grown in small, backyard gardens and sold at daily auctions.

  Ethiopian coffee growers serve as particularly effective symbolic material for Starbucks. As the birthplace of coffee, Ethiopia offers the most authentic coffee experience in a marketplace dominated by mass-marketed brands. African imagery�photos of farmers, landscapes, folk design�provides access to exotic culture, also highly prized by well-educated consumers. Finally, as a continent in dire economic straits and facing extraordinary humanitarian problems, the idea of supporting coffee producers through trade by buying an expensive local product has tremendous appeal, tapping into the ethical symbolism that Starbuck's customers find increasingly appealing to assuage their concerns about global inequalities.

  As Starbucks' revenues increasingly depend upon sweet blended drinks that have little to do with coffee, much less the cosmopolitan connoisseur worldview, Ethiopian coffee brands play an even more vital role in maintaining the imagery that makes the Starbucks brand so valuable. The more syrupy drinks and sugary cakes Starbucks sells, the more it needs to aggressively promote its ""roots"" in the artisanal, decommercialized world of African coffees to act as a counterbalance to its fast food-like offerings.

  Starbucks strategy of late has been to upsell these exotic coffees, turning them into a small but immensely profitable niche. Starbucks has launched the Black Apron Exclusives� line, with luxurious packaging and a tagline that boasts of coffee that is ""Rare, Exotic, Cherished."" Sidamo and Harrar feature prominently in this line. In the US, Starbucks has retailed these coffees for $24-26/lb, instead of the $10-13/lb for the standard whole bean coffees, a doubling of their prior price, executed simply by positioning them as even more special, exotic, and scarce.

  The Black Apron Exclusives line is not only a profitable niche. Its primary role is to provide a halo for the entire Starbucks brand. While few customers are willing to shell out for these extremely expensive coffees, the range is placed front and center in the stores on display so that all Starbucks customers, even those ordering a Bananas & Cr�me Frappuccino � Blended Cr�me, can feel good about the fact that they are still participating in the rarified cosmopolitan connoisseur culture.

  Ethiopian Coffees as Ingredient Brands

  Starbucks strategy is to use Sidamo, Yirgacheffe, and Harrar�along with other prestigious coffees from Africa, Indonesia, and Central America�to serve as what marketers call ingredient brands. Ingredient brands are brands that are used as one component ""ingredient"" of another branded product or service. Gore waterproof fabric and Intel computer chips are classic examples. Consumers view the ingredient's inclusion as a distinctive and valuable addition to the offer. The ingredient is revealed to end-consumers through some sort of distinctive mark (name, logo, etc.) so that the inclusion of the ingredient increases the perceived value of the offering.

  The consistent promotion of Sidamo, Yirgacheffe, and Harrar by a wide variety of specialty coffee marketers as amongst the best, most distinctive, and most authentic coffees in the world, using the mode of artisanal branding described above, has�as an unintended consequence�built these coffees into powerful and valuable ingredient brands. But, while consumers widely perceive these coffees as valuable brands, two of the three have not been recognized in the United States as legal commercial entities. Therein lies the rub. Despite the fact that consumers value these coffees, Ethiopian producers cannot capture any of this value because their coffee brands do not have legal standing as a trademark.

  Starbucks Market Power Means Starving Farmers

  If coffee traded as free marketers predict, one would expect that as the perceived value of Ethiopian coffee brands increased, so too would the incomes of Ethiopian farmers. Unfortunately, few markets actually operate in such a well-lubricated manner. And the specialty coffee market in particular works according to principles nearly antithetic to this ideal.

  Even though the perceived value of Ethiopian coffees has increased tremendously, none of this value is getting passed back to the producers. Despite the fact that they are producing some of the most valued coffee in the world, Ethiopian farmers are struggling to stay alive, many living below subsistence levels, nowhere close to the heart-warming photos of industrious happy peasants often found in Starbucks marketing. In fact, the commodity price is so low that many farmers are trading out coffee production to grow khat�the slightly narcotic drug of choice in East Africa. Those farmers who stay in the market have no incentive to grow good coffee, and no ability to invest in their crops. Rather than free markets, what we have is market failure.

  The specialty coffee market is failing simply because a handful of companies like Starbucks have extraordinary market power and are able to use this power to control the value chain. Starbucks is able to play off the millions of small producers around the world and so are able to set the terms of trade. By comparison, in Ethiopia, specialty beans are produced by an estimated 600,000 small growers with little knowledge of commodities markets, no capital reserves, and no ability to act cohesively as a group to sell their coffee. As a result prices are set for them at niggardly world commodity levels and they have no choice but to take it.

  Because Ethiopian brands are traded under the Starbucks trademark, Starbucks controls the transaction with customers and reaps the economic benefits. On the Black Apron line, Starbucks earns $24.00/lb. or more, with gross margins that likely exceed $20.00. Back in Ethiopia, the farmers who supplied their premier land, distinctive plants, cultivation techniques, and hard labor earned less than a dollar. It should not be a surprise that Ethiopians are looking for a means to gain more leverage in the market so that their farmers can earn more for their coffee.

  here is the following:

  Why Ethiopia Needs Trademarks

  In the United States, Ethiopia has two options to turn its regions into legal entities: trademarks and certification marks. The Ethiopian Intellectual Property Office views the trademark as a far more effective vehicle to gain commercial leverage for two simple reasons. First, the trademark will give the coffee sector a commercial asset that it can control in the marketplace. With the trademark, American coffee retailers will be required to obtain a licensing agreement to sell Ethiopian coffees, and so Ethiopian producers would have the power to set the terms of trade. The coffee sector would be able to manage their coffee brands as a business rather than letting them be managed by the whims of the global commodity exchange. Only if trademarks are granted can Ethiopia counter the market power of Starbucks. With a certification mark, Starbucks and other Western coffee marketers would still have full control over Ethiopian coffee brands.

  Second, certification schemes are not only toothless, they are also impossible to enforce. Certification requires that the government oversee producers and distributors to guarantee that the coffees sold belong to a particular style or region. An estimated 600,000 farmers spread throughout Ethiopia in remote areas now grow specialty coffees. And distribution is done informally, by hauling bags on foot for many kilometers. It is simply not possible to oversee these producers; and even if it were, it would require an onerous surcharge on farmers who are already often living below subsistence level.

  With trademarks in hand, Ethiopian producers can collaborate to effectively manage their brands, working with trusted distributors and retailers to manage coffee quality, pricing, and marketing. Trademarks would allow Sidamo, Harrar, and Yirgacheffe to be managed by their rightful owners rather than by the players in the market with the most power.

  The case is straightforward. The Ethiopian coffee sector wants to participate in the marketplace on an equal footing with companies in the North. They want to own their brands, rather than hand over the value to Starbucks and others. With ownership in hand, Ethiopian producers would finally have a real chance to significantly increase the earnings of millions who are now desperately poor.

  Starbucks Position

  Starbucks and its lobbying groups have now gone public in their fight against the Ethiopian trademarks. Starbucks offers two challenges. First the company claims that the Ethiopian brands cannot be trademarked because they are actually generic terms for coffee rather than distinctive and valued marks. Such a claim is easily refuted. Starbucks own ingredient branding strategy demonstrates that Starbucks management does not believe its own rhetoric. Second, Starbucks is trying to persuade the public that the trademarks are against the interests of Ethiopian farmers. Starbucks argues that. ""the trademark application is not based upon sound economic advice and that the proposal as it stands would hurt Ethiopian coffee farmers economically."" No argument detailing this claim is offered.

  Recently The Economist has jumped into the fray to coach its business audience on the wisdom of Starbucks rhetoric. An editorial published on November 7 parrots Starbucks views with none of the economic rigor that the magazine champions. Though, what the article lacked in analysis, it made up for in colonial finger wagging: ""The Ethiopian government, one of the most economically illiterate in the modern world, would do well to take Starbucks's advice.""

  This is a disingenuous, hypocritical, and patronizing claim. Starbucks opposes Ethiopia's efforts in order to shore up its market power, not out of paternal concern for the plight of Africa. Starbucks is worried about losing economic control of ingredient brands that their customers increasingly value. Starbucks has previously treated the Ethiopian coffee brands as its own property simply because they could. Now that Ethiopia is asserting its right to control its intellectual property, Starbucks can defend its position only by making a nonsensical argument: the coffee brands that Starbucks believes to be of such great value that it has used them for decades to promote its most esteemed coffees are of no economic value to Ethiopia! Rather than fess up to the company's true motives, Starbucks claims to be acting in the interests of Ethiopian farmers by refusing to grant them commercial ownership of their local coffee brands!

  While in the current political climate, perhaps such Orwellian logic should not be surprising, it is a shock to find this kind of rhetoric coming from a company that takes great pride in its ethical sourcing policies. Starbucks' assertion that it has the right to decide how Ethiopians should transact their business interests�superceding the views of Ethiopian farmers, coffee co-ops, and exporters�is offensive and an abuse of market power. If managed well, the trademarking scheme will no doubt serve Ethiopian farmers very well. If managed poorly, it won't. This is how capitalist markets work. It's not for Starbucks to say that Ethiopia should not participate in the marketplace with the same legal rights that have allowed Starbucks to prosper so.

  Brand Stewardship at Starbucks: Win the Battle, Lose the Brand?

  In their rash attempt to shut down Ethiopia's applications, CEO Jim Donald and his senior management team have placed the Starbucks brand in significant peril. Because Starbucks markets to educated middle-class consumers, increasingly attuned to ethical issues in the marketplace, the company has no choice but to pursue highly visible activities that burnish the Starbucks brand as ""progressive"" and ""ethical."" Customers are comforted by the fact that Starbucks is now selling Estima� Fair trade coffee and Ethos� ethical water. Starbucks works hard to cultivate an image as a progressive business partner, promoting sustainable coffee production especially amongst the poorest coffee growers.

  Once the word is out, Starbucks customers will be shocked by the disconnect between their current perceptions of Starbucks ethics and the company's actions against Ethiopia. It is not an exaggeration to compare this case to Nike's purposeful ignorance to deal with the sweatshops producing their shoes. Just as consumers were disgusted by the fact that Air Jordans sold for $120 while Asian laborers produced the shoes in what amounted to slave labor conditions, they will be equally disturbed by the fact that Starbucks is happy to sell coffee for $26/lb while refusing to allow the coffee's producers a shot at climbing out of desperate poverty. Ironically, Starbucks' anti-development stance is likely to cause significant damage to their brand, imposing a far greater hit on profits than any increase in commodity prices the company might encounter were they to support Ethiopia's cause.

  Development Starbucks Style: Keeping Africa Capitalism-Free?

  Starbucks management is reacting in such an aggressive and rash way because they're scared to death that if Ethiopia wins its trademarks, the company's seemingly impenetrable hold on the specialty coffee value chain will start to fall apart. Foreseeing a domino effect worthy of cold war paranoia, Starbucks no doubt worries that Ethiopian trademarks will beget similar efforts from Kenya, Indonesia, Costa Rica and the like. Down the road, specialty coffee producers might garner enough market leverage to demand 20% or 30% of the value created, rather than the 6-10% they earn today. These increased earnings will come out of Starbucks pocket.

  While such battles for market power are a commonplace occurrence, this time much more is at stake than the redistribution of profits. Ethiopia's trademark strategy is one of the most promising developments in the push to improve Africa's commercial leverage in global markets. Political elites around the world have been stumping to improve African trade, and the rhetoric is having an impact. But this advocacy has so far been myopic�focusing on trade barriers for commodities.

  If the North really wants to help develop Africa, then we need to talk not only about opening up trade, but about building valued-added businesses that are owned by Africans so that Africans can capture profits from Northern markets. To raise African economic standards requires moving African products up the value chain�from the low-margin commodity markets now controlled by the North to branded offerings that demand good prices in export markets. Ethiopians cannot dig themselves out of poverty unless they are allowed to participate meaningfully in the value chain. Cultivating markets for their own branded goods is one exciting path toward that end. Let's hope that Starbucks allows them to do so.

          Printer-friendly 
          version  
          A 
          full house   ushered in the Mike Mularkey era in Buffalo on Sunday, 
          when the Bills hosted the Jacksonville Jaguars. The game was uneventful 
          for the most part, but remained undecided until the final play, and 
          when Byron Leftwich�s prayer was answered, the Jaguars left town with 
          a 13-10 victory.�   
          That 
          final play was a microcosm of the four quarters; ugly, somewhat effective 
          and competitive. It also appears to be a good indicator of what to expect 
          15 more times this year�close, competitive, sometimes effective, ugly 
          football. The Bills will win a few and lose more than a few, but the 
          team and the upper management are just giving the Bills fans what they 
          want, right?  
          This 
          game was a sellout, almost every other game is going to be a sellout�heck, 
            preseason   games have sold out. It would seem as long as there 
          are 53 people dressed up in Bills uniforms the seats will be full. The 
          state of affairs at One Bills Drive has never been better. Bills GM 
          Tom Donahoe is second only to God in Ralph Wilson�s book, and he is 
          gaining ground every day. Not even during the Kelly years did fans show 
          up like they do now. Donahoe has the Sabres brass shaking their heads 
          in amazement. How does he do it? The Sabres have been putting, an ugly, 
          sometimes competitive, sometimes effective product on the ice for years 
          now, they don�t get that kind of fan reaction. In fact, they get ripped 
          apart in the media and throughout the community for it.  
          It 
          was about nine months ago when Donahoe fired (technically the Bills 
          chose not to re-sign) former coach Gregg Williams, much to the pleasure 
          of the fans of the team. Many would say it came too late; the media 
          and most fans had been calling for Williams� head for the better part 
          of two years, but Donahoe stuck with him until the very end. When he 
          let Williams go, he admitted that he had made a mistake in hiring Williams 
          three years earlier, and claimed his next hire would be better. I need 
          to remember that�just admit you were wrong, and then it�s okay to screw 
          up your job.   
          But 
          that was only half the story that day. He also made comments regarding 
          the fans, the media, and all others in the area who seemed to take pleasure 
          in questioning the strategy of the former coach and taking shots at 
          the team. He actually said he was embarrassed to be a part of a community 
          that acted that way, and that we should be ashamed. Maybe Donahoe doesn�t 
          understand that fan is short for fanatic. Once a few people in the PR 
          department explained to Tommy boy that probably wasn�t a good thing 
          to say, he came out later in the day and held his own press conference 
          to try to re-spin his comments. Crazy thing is, all was forgotten. Five 
          months later tickets went on sale, and the show went on like nothing 
          happened. The man is the Teflon Tom.  
          Well 
          after the Bills� performance on Sunday, it is time to remember those 
          comments. Mr. Donahoe, do you want to know what an embarrassment is? 
          It�s that product on the field Sunday afternoon, not the community that 
          stands behind it. When a GM is hired, there usually is a three or maybe 
          even a five-year plan for success. This is the fourth year of the Donahoe 
          regime�what kind of plan are the Bills on here, anyway?   
          I 
          understand this is only the first game, and Buffalo could win the next 
          15 in a row, but time for a reality check: that is not going to happen. 
          That wasn�t Joe Montana, Tom Brady, or Peyton Manning going down the 
          field the last two minutes that was the Jacksonville Jaguars, led by 
          Byron Leftwich. Yeah, I know Leftwich was a first round pick, and I 
          know some prognosticators are picking the Jags to challenge for a wild 
          card this year, and maybe they will; who cares? That isn�t the point. 
          The Bills should be in the same boat, but unfortunately they are more 
          likely to end up with last year�s abysmal 6-10 record than a chance 
          at the playoffs. It should be viewed as unacceptable, but apparently, 
          judging by tickets sales, it�s okay with most Bills fans. After all, 
          somebody�s got to suck, right?  
          The 
          team does have some decent young talent�JP Lohsman, Lee Evans and Willis 
          McGahee, to name a few, but that is two or three years away. I guess 
          that puts the Bills and Donahoe on a seven-year plan. I�m not sure what 
          I like less, the thought of four more years with G.W. Bush or Tom Donahoe.

TDA Book Review - You Gotta Have Wa

  You Gotta Have Wa  
  by Robert Whiting  

Reviewed by David Marasco  

No set of book reviews on baseball outside of the United States would be complete without a long look at Robert Whiting's ""You Gotta Have Wa.""  Whiting, an American-born sports writer in Tokyo has published a pair of books about baseball in Japan.  His first, ""The Chrysanthemum and the Bat"" is hard to find but considered to be a classic.  You Gotta Have Wa is top notch and should be required reading for any American who wants to explore the realm of baseball in Japan.  

This is not a book about Japanese baseball.  Instead, it is an account of how Americans have navigated their way through the version of baseball that is played on that island.  The book starts with a description of the coming of Bob Horner.  Horner is an Atlanta Brave who tests the free agent market in America and finds it wanting.  He takes an offer from the Yakult team in Japan and signs a contract.  We are treated to a tragic cycle that would seem to have its roots in ancient Greece.  Horner starts the season on fire, wowing the baseball public.  Then, as prophesied by fellow Americans,  he falls into a slump and  his non-Japanese methods are questioned by the media and the fans.  When he goes on the disabled list, he is roundly criticized for not playing through the pain as would ""any decent Japanese.""  The rabid Japanese media sets upon him and raises him up as an example of everything wrong with American products.  Then, with a healthy back and a new batting style designed to counter biased umpiring, Horner returns and destroys opposing pitching.  While the Swallows do not win a pennant, they establish new team records for attendance, due in part to their exciting import.  But when the time came for Horner and the Swallows to ink a new contract Horner decides that he has seen enough.  He flees back to the United States.

The story of Bob Horner serves to whet the appetite for an examination into the mindset that pervades baseball in Japan.  It and the two chapters that follow set the table for the rest of the book.   First there is a short treatment of the history of baseball in Japan.  The pastime started as a competition between prep schools and until the 1930's remained a purely amateur undertaking, although one has the suspicion that it was about as amateur as the old East German woman's swimming program.  In 1934 Babe Ruth came to Japan on tour with other American big leaguers and proved to be a star of the first magnitude.  Within two years a professional circuit popped into existence.  After a brief hiatus during World War II,  professional baseball was reborn, and quickly developed into the two league setup that exists to this day.  

With the historical context set, Whiting then examines some cases that play up the difference in spirit between Japanese baseball and its American counterpart.  His first study is that of Choji Murata, a star pitcher for the Lotte Orions.  Like all Japanese pitchers, Murata subjected his arm to stresses and tortures that would be considered  anathema in Western  thinking.  Not surprisingly, after many years he found that his elbow was wracked with pain.  He tried for a year to solve his problem by doing what he had  always done, ignore the pain and pitch regardless.  But he was so ineffective that his team would not allow him to play.  Instead he threw hundreds of practice pitches every day.  The Lotte Orions had to get an injunction to keep him from doing so.  Finally he was down to what he considered to be his last option - a visit to America for a  consultation with Dr. Frank Jobe.  Strangely, in the country that gave the world arthroscopic knee operations, surgery was considered by all the gray beards to be the end of an athletic career.  Still, Murata had tried all the traditional approaches and they had failed.  He went under the knife and was able to resurrect his career.  Even after all that, he is said to look down upon other pitchers who undergo surgery upon injury.  Only as a matter of last resort does Murata see the choice as justified.   

The spotlight then turns to iron man Sachio Kinugasa, who held the consecutive games played mark until he was recently surpassed by Cal Ripken Jr.  Kinugasa played through all types on injuries, including a 1979 fractured shoulder blade.  When asked how he could play with a broken shoulder Kinugasa responded by claiming that it onlyhurt when he swung, whereas if he didn't play he would feel pain for the duration of  the game.  Japan's iron man represents the concept of doryoku, which has the rough English translation of ""effort.""  The central role played by doryoku in the game is a rough spot between Americans and their hosts.  A marathon pre-game practice in the muggy Japanese Summer is simply an expected expression of doryoku to a native player.  It is a waste of time and energy to the guest.

  Tatsunori Hara   is used to show the role of respect for superiors.  Hara was raised as Mary Pierce or Todd Marinovich, a child trained to excel in the sporting world.  Whiting claims that Hara has always followed the advice of his coaches, and yet hasn't experienced a true breakthrough year that should be expected of a player of his caliber.  Whiting then quotes some American players who feel that the monkey on Hara's  is the coaching that he receives, that Hara would come into his own (an interesting cultural Freudian slip if I've ever written one) if only allowed to do his own thing rather than be over-trained by his cadre of advisors.  

The rest of the chapter is devoted to the concept of ""Wa""  - in English, unity or group harmony.  A rogue's gallery of individualistic behavior is presented, and each time the offender is severely disciplined for upsetting the Wa of the team.  On the other hand, sometimes it appears that what the guilty party is truly being punished for is undermining the team's chain of command.  To my Western mind it is at times hard to tell if Wa is something real or just a reason given when a bad apple is tossed from the barrel.  When a musical group breaks up the phrase ""philosophical differences"" is often batted about.  I doubt that the force behind the dissolution of the group was that the drummer was a Cartesian and the bassist was a follower of Spinoza.  I wonder if ""Wa"" and ""philosophical differences"" are just nicer ways of saying ugly things.  

With the first three chapters Whiting has done a good job of introducing the different psyche of Japanese baseball.  His description of the rise, fall, resurrection and departure of Bob Horner is both engaging and eye-opening.  It is well written, setting the stage for many of the issues raised later in the book.  While I wish that the author had spent more time in his history section, he did tell his story without getting bogged down.  It would be  a mistake to allow this section to expand and subtract from the main thrust of the book.  Finally, Whiting brings abstract concepts of Japanese baseball into play by using figures from the game.  This allows a human basis for abstractions like doryoku, while at the same time introduces the reader to some of the stars of the game.  Even if the book  ended here, it would be worth the price.

With a strong base, Whiting builds higher.  Chapter 4 deals with various episodes from the up and down history of foreign players in the Japanese game.  These range over troubles with management, violent behavior, long, seemingly pointless practices and unfair umpires.  It comes off as more a laundry list than  a deep discussion of the roots of these problems.

The next  section covers the topic of oendan, the organized groups of fans that fill baseball stadiums.  They seem to combine the passion of British football fans with the restraint of nobility.  In America if a player wants to slam on the quality of fan, one of his accusations is normally that the ""fans don't know anything about baseball, they just cheer when the scoreboard tells them to.""  In Japan this is the expected role.  The fan  is devoted to the team and will cheer or sing the entire way through the game. 

This is an interesting sidelight to the tour of Japanese baseball culture.  I really enjoy the excerpts from the fight songs.  It goes a little to far astray into pop psychology, talking about how baseball gives the normally staid Japanese a chance to be wild, and yet even in this action the Japanese do it only as a group.  These are simply aspects of the same mob psychology that can be seen at any packed stadium, regardless of location or culture.

The topic of interpreters is covered in the chapter entitled Sandwich Man.  One would think a  team with a multimillion dollar investment in a player would make sure that it had a translator that could speak English.  I know that if I was a player going overseas, this would be written into my contract.  Surprisingly, this is not the case.  The reader is treated to funny situations like the time the interpreter looked up ""hit and run"" in the dictionary and read about car accidents.  Or the time a player told an interviewer that he was no longer mad about a certain incident and the public was informed that he was no longer insane.  The chapter soon turns a bit more serious and explores the more important role that the interpreter plays, that of the buffer between the American player and his surroundings.  In one case a player challenged an opposing catcher during warmups about the previous day's beanball incident.  Rather than delivering a threat of violence, the translator instead asked the catcher not to throw at the player's head anymore, because it worried the player's wife and children.  This drew an apology from the catcher, and the headhunting ceased.

This is a marvelous chapter.  It would be a mistake to see it simply as ""tales from the front"" from the point of view of the translator.  Whiting is able to get a lot of mileage out of this section.  He makes the point that many owners see the teams as nothing more than advertising vehicles for the parent corporations, and hence get the same translators as would any branch, even if this means that the employee knows nothing about baseball.  He also plays up the fact that Japanese education is based upon book learning and as a result churns out interpreters who are very poor at conversational English, and more tragically, exchange students who do not know the meaning of ""Freeze.""  Whiting could have played up the clownish aspects of this chapter, but instead he uses it to explore some important issues.

Covered next is the tenure of Don Blasingame.  He is one of a handful of Westerners who have been given the reigns of a Japanese squad.   His adventures with the Hanshin Tigers are closely detailed, especially when he has to choose between a struggling American player and an unproved rookie.  In America even the most promising rookies are dealt with a good deal of skepticism, and gains respect only through play.  With the larger role of amateur ball in Japan, many rookies are stars in their own right before they play an inning of big league baseball.  They can play the role of savior like a John Elway or a Shaquille O'Neal.  Blasingame  had his problems with the media and management and was eventually let go.  He also manage with Nankai, with undistinguished results.

This chapter seems a bit dated when read today.  If this chapter were revised I'm sure that the reader would be treated to the travails of Bobby Valentine.  The issues dealing with playing time for rookies are probably better treated in another chapter.  This section suffers in comparison with the previous one in that I feel that it deals more with the specifics of Blasingame's career as opposed to more general issues withthe intercultural relationship.

Chapter eight sees a return to the topic of American players in the Japanese game.  In this case the history of Americans and the Tokyo Giants is covered.  After a long period where the Giants played with no Americans, they went after Davey Johnson.  Johnson was a star, a power-hitting middle infielder in America.  He was hampered by injuries his first year, and vowed to make amends the following season.  He became one of a handful of Americans to take part in ""voluntary training"" in the middle of Winter and started the season well, but injured his hand sliding into second.  His play declined and his manager would often bench him.  Finally he decided to go to America for medical help over the All-Star break.  This caused an uproar, he was seen as abandoning his team and insulting Japanese doctors.  The word from his physician was that he was to avoid batting practice.  Johnson struck a deal with his manager.   So long as he produced he could stay in the lineup and not practice.  Amazingly, this deal was struck, and Johnson caught fire.  Sadly, he got sick at the end of the season and feels that he was scapegoated for the Giants post-season loss.  Whiting then moves on to Johnson's teammate, Whiting spends the rest of the chapter detailing the life and times of ""Crazy"" Wright, Reggie Smith, and Warren Cromartie.  While each tale is interesting in its own right, there does seem to be repetition in the cycle of big hopes, misunderstandings, comebacks and eventual departures.    

This chapter was about how the Tokyo Giants handled their foreigner problem.  While it added a lot of insight, I felt that we could also learn from what a lesser franchise did with its outsiders.  Perhaps a side-by-side treatment, tracing the Giants and some other team.  The problem is that the Giants are such an entity all to their own, it is hard to extrapolate from them.

After many pages detailing the behavioral difficulties of Americans in Japan, Whiting spends a chapter on the Shinjin-rui, or ""new breed.""  These are native players who reject the traditional ways of the game.  The first on the hit list is Hiromitsu Ochiai.  He would predict triple crowns for coming seasons, an act that would be seen as braggadocio in the United States, but absolutely shocking in Japan.  He could get away with it because he delivered what he promised.  He would skip ""voluntary"" Winter workouts and would not practice hard.  He also demanded big Yen, and even smeared Nagashima and Oh for not working harder to get the salaries that they deserved.  Whiting pairs Ochiai with Suguru Egawa, a renegade pitcher.  Egawa was a college star who decided that he would only play for the Giants.  After being drafted by another team he simply sat out for a year.  Claiming that after 365 days he was free, he signed with the Giants before he was slected by the Hanshin Tigers in the following year's draft.  There was a great furor and the Giants even threatened to withdraw and form a new league.  In the end Tokyo sent a top pitcher to the Tigers for the rights to Egawa.  His splash into baseball was a harbinger of future actions.  He never stayed in shape and didn't throw the hundreds of practice pitches between starts.  Even worse, if he didn't feel like pitching he would simply skip his slot in the rotation.  When Egawa retired early many  felt that he owed the Giants more loyalty.  After Ochiai and Egawa, Whiting discusses other Japanese badboys.

I have to wonder if the focus of this chapter is set correctly.  In both America and Japan athletes are spoiled. treated as if they were gods among mortals.  Some handle it with grace and dignity, and others let it go to their heads.  ""Out of control"" players should be expected from this environment.  But this has always been true.  The difference today is that instead of being willing to protect the players elements of the press circle like sharks.  Any dirty laundry in the modern game is quickly exposed.  Players like Mantle and Ruth would be flayed alive by today's sports writers for their off field actions.  I have to ask if the rise in poor behavior in Japan is a real phenomenon or if it had always been there and is now being revealed by a more predatory press.  If Whiting had taken this into account I think it would have been more interesting from a sociological point of view.  Still, a strong background in the Egawa affair would have helped everyone involved in last Summer's Irabu situation. 

  Yoshiaki Tsutsumi   is reported to be the richest man in the world.  He also owns the Seibu Lions.  Whiting takes time to look at this man and his team.  Tsutsumi runs his organization ""like an army,"" and unlike most Japanese owners, expects to see a profit from his franchise.  The chapter reads like a mini-seminar on business in Japan.  Interesting, but nothing that hasn't been said before.  

While I can understand that Whiting wanted to cover the big wheels in Japanese baseball, and Tsutsumi is definitely one of them, he managed to pick out a team run in a somewhat American fashion.  Time would have been better spent examining the inner workings of one of the other franchises.  Whiting touches upon other teams, stating that they are in effect advertising wings for their parent companies (he points out that Yakult sales go down in cities where the Swallows have beaten the locals).  I think that a closer look at the concept of ownership and team mission would have been a better aim of this section.  In Japan, the team is identified with the company.  While Americans have put corporate logos on almost all of their stadiums, we will probably never see the advent of the Tribune Cubs.

After spending a chapter on Japan's ultimate professional, the focus turns to the amateur game.  Specifically Koshien, the 49 team single elimination tournament held every Summer.  Perhaps the closest picture that could be painted is two weeks worth of college bowl games all held in the Rose Bowl.  Attendance for 1988 was placed at 820,000.  And despite the size and tradition of bowl games, they come up short in comparison with Koshien.  Score 4 touchdowns and in 20 years even the most ardent alumni will have problems remembering your name.  Hit a clutch homer at Koshien and you will be immortalized.  This can drive things to the extreme.  Whiting chooses to look at PL Gakuen, a Koshien powerhouse.  Their players are scouted and selected carefully before admission.  They practice for hours a day on top of their 200 games a year.  Their baseball budget runs ten times that of a typical school.  Each upperclassman on the team is assigned a lowerclassman as a servant.  Some students sleep through class, saving their energy for the field.  While Whiting does strive for balance, he paints an ugly picture of the highschool game, with comparisons to Nazis and stories of children dying in practice.  While there is some good, there is a lot of bad.

Sadly, I think that in this area Japan and America have a lot in common.  Just look at football in Texas or basketball in Chicago if you want to see corruption.  How many coaches use puberty as an excuse when it is pointed out that their players gained 40 pounds in the off season?  How many wrestlers die trying to make weight?  A quick viewing of Hoop Dreams will cure anybody who thinks that high school sports is anything close to pure.  One source in the chapter talked about condoms in hotel rooms as if it were some source of scandal.  Heck, in America that's one of the main reasons to try out for the team.  Yes, Whiting paints an ugly picture, but it is a familiar one.

The last chapter in the book once again details the troubles of Americans in Japanese baseball.  In a way, it is also a final exam for both the author and the reader.  While the stories match up pretty well with what has gone before, this time the reader should have a better understanding of why friction exists between the Americans and their hosts.  Whiting has done his job well if this chapter comes across as predictable.  At the same time, he also teaches about the more recent history of the game.

This book is a gem.  It should be on everybody's shelf.  With the opening of the floodgates started by Nomo, we will see many more players from Japan entering the National and American Leagues.  Will the same mistakes and misunderstandings that hindered Americans in Japan rise again in the United States?  I have to wonder.  While most teams have several coaches who are at least semi-fluent in Spanish, what is the quality of translators for the Japanese?  The entire Irabu situation had played itself out years before with Egawa, are there other cases like that we should know about?  When I went to Japan many years ago I saw McDonalds franchises, and here in America I can't go five minutes without seeing a Japanese product.  The two countries share so much more than baseball.  Yet at the same time there are elements of each culture that are completely alien to the other.  Baseball is a good place to see what we have in common, and where we rub like sandpaper.  Whiting's book serves as a great map to the terrain.

        A Japanese company ( Toyota ) and an American company (General Motors) decided to have a canoe race on the Missouri River.  Both teams practiced long and hard to reach their peak performance before the race.  On the big day, the Japanese won by a mile.  The Americans, very discouraged and depressed, decided to investigate the reason for the crushing defeat.  A management team composed of senior management was formed to investigate and recommend appropriate action. Their conclusion:  The Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, while the American team had 8 people steering and 1 person rowing.  Feeling a deeper study was in order, American management hired a consulting company and paid them a large amount of money for a second opinion.  They advised, of course, that too many people were steering the boat, while not enough people were rowing.  Not sure of how to utilize that information, but wanting to prevent another loss to the Japanese, the rowing team’s management structure was totally reorganized to 4 steering supervisors, 3 area steering superintendents and 1 assistant superintendent steering manager.  They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder. It was called the ‘Rowing Team Quality First Program,’ with meetings, dinners and free pens for the rower. The new change initiative also included plans for getting new paddles, canoes and other equipment, plus extra vacation days for practices and bonuses.  The next year the Japanese won by two miles.  Humiliated, the American management laid off the rower for poor performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles, and canceled all capital investments for new equipment. The money saved was distributed to the senior executives as bonuses and the next year’s racing team was outsourced to India .  Sadly, The End.  Sad, but oh so true! Here’s something else to think about: Ford has spent the last thirty years moving all its factories out of the US, claiming they can’t make money paying American wages. Toyota has spent the last thirty years building more than a dozen plants inside the US .  The last quarter’s results: Toyota makes 4 billion in profits while Ford racked up 9 billion in losses. Ford folks are still scratching their heads.

                    Here are some blog posts that caught my attention at mid-week. I'm pointing you to the Carnival of the Capitalists and the Carnival of Human Resources, and posts on HR at IBM, a parable of competitiveness, freakishly good customer service, a sense of wonder, and the best way to lose good ...

      Another illustration of this phenomenon occurred when Toyota began managing the NUMMI plant formerly managed by GM. With essentially the same workers, the plant went from one of the worst in the auto industry to one of the best.

    Wally Bock

      Wally:  The NUMMI experiment really showed the power of high performance work systems coupled with Japanese total quality control.  This again is the power of the approach used by Toyota, aka Toyota Production System.

      I've seen it go further. After laying off front line employees, I've seen top heavy organizations actually hire more managers! Inevitably work no longer gets done on time with fewer doers. Rather than hire front line employees which would virtually eliminate the need for managers, extra managers are brought in to battle over slivers of front liners' time.   Truth is stranger than fiction.

      Great story and very topical here in the UK as Ford are considering their future here.  I like this parable on 2 accounts - 1. It's a powerful story and as such it's ""difficult"" to forget and suppots the use of stories in business.  2. It warns us against over analysis.  Working in HR I often see organisations spending millions trying to measure intangibles or to link the ""soft"" issues to the bottom line.  Perhaps they should just keep it simple or they might end up up the creek without a paddle!?

      I was involved as a Project Director and reported to 10 individual executives and 3 committees. I know and have experienced the American style of managing quite a few times.

      A Modern Day Parable cont.  Well, it was time again for the annual canoe race between the America car company and the Japanese car company. For years, the Japanese team had been winning the race hands down, but the Americans closed the gap every year. “This year...” the Americans thought, “...this is our year.”  People who knew a thing or two about canoes all agreed that the Americans had finally brought a canoe to the race that was of comparable quality to the Japanese craft. Now if they could just get it in the water and off to a good start faster than the competition. They each grabbed a side of the canoe and a paddle and marched towards the river.  Arriving at the river’s edge, they noticed something unusual about their   rival’s team. The Japanese had new uniforms, new paddles, and even a huge canoe trailer. They didn’t even have to carry their canoe to the river! Worse yet, all their fancy gear was boldly emblazoned with the words “Courtesy of the Government of Japan.” This is an unfair advantage thought the Americans. No government agency is helping us – in fact, for some reason, our government seems to be trying to hurt our chances of winning this thing.  The Americans decided not to complain about the obvious cheating, and put their canoe in the water anyway.  A shot rang out and the race began with both teams paddling furiously. It was neck and neck through the first half of the race. The Americans were sweating and straining, mustering all their strength and experience to keep up with the fit, efficient, and harmonious rowing of the Japanese team.  And indeed they were keeping up! Against all the odds, they could compete in this race after all!  Over the years, they had gotten complacent. The team had definitely enjoyed a few too many cheeseburgers and not enough exercise. They were working on it though - and they held fast to the hope that this would be the year they could at least tie the Japanese. “Keep paddling,” they thought, “just keep paddling.”  But little did the Americans know they had one more obstacle to overcome. One very imposing obstacle.  This race was in America, on an American river, and the shores were lined on both sides with American canoeing fans. Yet, much to the chagrin of the American team, it soon became obvious that the crowd was cheering louder for the Japanese team. What heartbreak! Why?? We’re your neighbors and your countrymen. Our kids go to the same schools as yours, our paychecks support the same police and fire department as yours. We cheer for the same sports teams and eat at the same restaurants. When one of you is in peril, it’s us who rush to your aid! Why have you forsaken us? If you don’t help us win this race, we will eventually all lose.  Their spirit broken, the American team barely lost to the Japanese, but   vowed to come back even stronger next year.  The American car companies employ 395,000 Americans, or 87% of the domestic automotive workforce. True, the American car companies take too much of their profits and give it to overpaid executives, but they also plow a lot of it back into our art museums, symphonies, community groups, civic and charitable organizations, and yep, taxes. Toyota’s corporate profits go straight back to Japan, where the Japanese people have a better understanding of what's truly at stake in this canoe race. Still think your Toyota is an American car?  Root for the home team.  -Jim Fracassa, Detroit

      Jim:  Nice creative reply.  Here is a good article covering the real reasons for Toyota's success.  http://www.eaber.org/intranet/documents/40/376/AJRC_Anderson_03.pdf  Globalization certainly does have its pluses and minuses.  robert edward cenek

  Network Intrusion Prevention Global Leader  
  Top Layer Networks is dedicated to its role as the leading global provider of 
  Network Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), developing and bringing to market 
  network security infrastructure solutions that help commercial and government 
  organizations protect their critical on-line assets from the losses and risks 
  associated with cyber threats. Its family of IPS appliances is designed with 
  Three Dimensional Protection (3DP) that provides the most advanced protection 
  capabilities against known and unknown attacks at the highest tested performance 
  rates.   

  Company Statistics  
    Customers:   Over 1000 global corporate and government customers in 21 
  countries  
    Markets:   Network security solutions for Global 2000 Enterprises, Service 
  Providers, and Governments  
    Industry focus:   Financial Services, Healthcare, Retail/E-Commerce, Government, 
  Education, Critical Infrastructure, and Service Providers  
  Technology:   Patent-pending ASIC-based, high performance, deep packet inspection 
  hardware architecture and innovative intrusion prevention software, combined 
  with leading management solution (SecureCommand) and the TopResponse Automated 
  Update service  
    Experience:   IP networking and security expertise combined with mission 
  critical solution deployment.  

  The Need for Defense-In-Depth -- 
  Customers Demand Network Intrusion Prevention  

An increasing number 
      of organizations are using network intrusion prevention systems in addition 
      to other network security measures to mitigate information security risks. 
      This is a generally positive development, as inline intrusion prevention 
      systems with deep packet inspection capabilities are critical to protecting 
      corporate networks. However, even among those forward-looking companies 
      that have adopted IPS, too many are doing so in an incomplete fashion, focusing 
      only on certain risks that have top-of-mind currency, thereby exposing them 
      to serious varieties of risks they had not considered.  
	    Enterprises 
      must have a sound intrusion prevention strategy across the three threat 
      dimensions:   Undesired access  , wherein intruders gain access to such 
      invaluable assets as proprietary intellectual property or customer identity/credit 
      information;   malicious content  , including viruses, spyware and other 
      types, which can cause troubles that range from mild annoyances to cost-prohibitive 
      extended network downtime and loss of stored material; and   rate-based 
      attacks  , which intentionally overload computers or networks with garbage 
      traffic for the purpose of preventing legitimate traffic from reaching its 
      destination, resulting in lost revenue and brand damage for the attacked. 
      A three-dimensional approach which addresses all three of these attack techniques 
      is critical to prevent being hurt by complex hybrid attacks that use multiple 
      techniques to quickly spread malicious executables, techniques that can 
      beat traditional security point measures.  

	    The Solution: IPS 5500  
  In order to best combat the threats posed by undesired access, malicious content, 
  and rate-based attacks (and complex hybrid attacks that use multiple elements 
  of these to circumvent static, one-dimensional security tools), enterprises 
  should select and deploy a network IPS solution that addresses all three in 
  an integrated, mutually-reinforcing fashion - as Top Layer Networks does with 
  its   ""Three Dimensional Protection"" (3DP)   approach.

        Rotorcraft Ltd.   

        The Executive Team  
        Our Executive Team members are from widely diverse backgrounds, 
        all very successful in their respective fields. Our team believes in the 
        Pegasus MkIII and is devoted to successfully manufacturing this aircraft 
        and its future generations. We believe in the importance of this aircraft 
        and its potential impact on the world market place.  
        President: Joseph R. Reinhard  
        Mr. Reinhard is the founder of Pegasus Rotorcraft Ltd. He 
        has had over thirty years of experience in the high tech environment holding 
        a variety of management positions. His interest in aviation has ranged 
        from pilot training to being a pilot examiner. As a pilot he has over 
        5000 hours and holds (4) ATP ratings: Commercial license for seaplanes; 
        Certification as a Gold seal flight instructor; Instrument Instructor 
        for airplanes and helicopters; Advance Ground Instructor. In addition, 
        he also has FAA certification as an Airframe and Power Plant mechanic 
        (A&P). As owner and operator of a flight school (Pegasus Aviation), 
        he offered flight training in his own aircraft, (airplanes, single and 
        multiengine, rotorcraft helicopter and gyroplanes). He also was a Pilot 
        and Written Test Examiner offering a complete package to students. Mr. 
        Reinhard provided a pre-purchase inspection service to those interested 
        in buying a used aircraft.  
        Secretary and Treasurer: C. Richard McNally  
        Mr. McNally was a Navy carrier pilot before embarking on 
        his civilian career. He has thirty-five years of business experience, 
        in a variety of U.S. based mining companies. He began in a sales position 
        in his first company, Flintkote Corporation (a fortune 500 company) and 
        advanced to Vice President of Marketing before he left. His next position 
        was at C.T.I. Corporation in Tucson, Arizona as Vice President and General 
        manager, Board Member, and part owner with full operational and financial 
        responsibilities for the parent company. During Mr. McNally's tenure there

        Mr. McNally was next offered and accepted a position with 
        Pegasus Rotorcraft Ltd., and has been with the Company every since.  
        Vice President of International Marketing and Sales: Iwao 
        Maruyama  
        Mr. Maruyama has over forty years of experience in International 
        business development, finance, and management. Mr. Maruyama founded Yokohama 
        TV and Audio, which was later, acquired by Hitachi Electric Home Appliance 
        Co. Ltd. The same year that he sold his business to Hitachi he started 
        a new and different business when awarded a contract by the Japanese Ministry 
        of Trade and Industry (MITI). He setup and maintained 24 offices around 
        the world for distribution of import auto parts from the U.S., Brazil, 
        Europe and Japan. Mr. Maruyama has been a driving force in design of new 
        product lines. Most recently he established Buso Chemical Co. Ltd. to 
        develop a new market for an all season road mix to meet Japans nationwide 
        demand for quick but durable road repair materials. It has been accepted 
        as the standard road mix with the Construction Ministry and local governments. 
        With this complete Mr. Maruyama accepted a position with Pegasus Rotorcraft 
        Ltd.

	  News   ›   News Archive   ›   Merck KGaA acquires Survac ApS, a Danish biotech company  
      Merck KGaA acquires Survac ApS, a Danish biotech company  Merck KGaA announced today that it has acquired the Danish biotechnology company Survac ApS for EUR 11 million. The acquisition is expected to be completed this year and will allow Merck KGaA to gain access to novel technologies for the treatment of cancer.   The founders of Survac have developed a technology to identify and modify peptides that are useful for therapeutic cancer vaccines. The acquisition includes all intellectual property owned by Survac, including a broad patent portfolio in the area of proteins that are essential for the survival of cancer cells and therefore ideal targets for cancer treatments.  In exploratory clinical trials, the lead candidate was able to generate strong immune response to cancer cells in patients without the need for elaborated delivery technologies or specialized adjuvants.  ""A key element of Merck's strategy in oncology is to expand our clinical pipeline of innovative, targeted cancer treatments, and Survac's lead candidate already shows highly encouraging results in exploratory clinical trials,"" said Dr. Wolfgang Wein, Senior Vice President responsible for Merck's Commercial Unit Oncology. ""The fit with Merck is excellent, as we already have clinical and production know-how in cancer vaccines and peptides.""  Merck KGaA will integrate Survac's activities into its research and development organization and intends to initiate pre-clinical development of the first product in 2006.  Survac ApS was founded in 2003 in Copenhagen with financial support from DTU Innovation and a consortium of Danish venture capital firms. The company's business is run on a virtual basis in collaboration with leading European academic institutes and clinics.

  Sir Nigel Crisp

  Sir   Nigel Crisp   NHS
Chief Executive  
  For latest updates see
text highlighted in red.  
  Because
of everything that had happened to me I thought it would be appropriate to bring
the matter to the attention of Sir   Nigel Crisp   the Chief Executive of the NHS. 
I felt this would be a particularly sensible thing to do as Sir Nigel had been
prominent in making public statements about the action the NHS would take in
relation to it's employees that it found fiddling hospital figures   (See
BBC Report January 2002  ).  Sir Nigel also gave evidence to the   House
of Commons Public Administration Select Committee on January 30th   where in
answer to the question from Ian Liddell-Grainger MP, ""If you come across
people you realise are bullying because they  have got to hit these
targets, what will you do to managers?"" (Sir   Nigel Crisp  ) ""Well, you
will perhaps have seen there is a code of conduct...."".  (ILG) Which
you brought out.  (Sir Nigel)
""....for managers which sets out the standards of behaviour that we expect.
I cannot remember the exact words in there, but there is something about respect
and respect for working with people within it. It is for the individual
employers, i.e., the trust boards or the health authority boards or whatever
actually to deal with breaches of that and with allegations about that"". 
(ILG) ""What if they are doing the bullying?"" (Sir Nigel Crisp) ""If
that were the case, then we have a whistle-blowing system which can be used"".  In addition I thought Sir Nigel might have
been sympathetic to my case because of the experiences that had taken place at
the John Radcliffe Hospital.  A  senior nurse, Colette O'Keefe,
who has been on sick leave for a year, alleged she and her children had been
threatened after raising concerns about public care and the considerable harm
that was happening to patients.  As a consequence an   independent
external review was set up into the Cardiac Services being provided at the John
Radcliffe      (Since
putting this link on this website the open and accountable NHS have removed this
report from the world wide web so that the public can no longer access the
report.  In the near future I will scan into this site a full copy of the
report so that the public can again see what happened at the Radciffe and the
conclusions about over what period the problems developed)  .  This  report reviewed what had
happened at the John
Radcliffe during the 1990's including the period when Sir   Nigel Crisp   was the Chief Executive (  See Crisp CV
John Radcliffe CE 1993 to 1997  ).  The report came to a number of
conclusions but found that in terms of nursing the success that the John
Radcliffe had enjoyed in the 1980's and early 1990's  started to change in
1993 and that from the mid 1990's the relationships between the surgeon's in the
cardiac unit started to deteriorate.  There was also a disciplinary hearing
in 1997 into approximately �33,000 of allegedly fraudulent claims for on-call
and emergency work going back several years. The external review also found that
an alleged event in 1997 was never properly investigated with the consequences
that it rumbled in the background continuing to fuel the internecine feuding
between the consultant staff.  A significant number of staff who gave
evidence spoke of their feeling that the ""drinking club culture"",
emerged in the early 1990's.   The whole  situation at the John
Radcliffe was reported in the press at the time and the conclusion was that the
failure at this hospital could be clearly attributed to failure of an   arrogant
and complacent management who had allowed the development of  a 'blame
culture' in which staff were 'encouraged to cover up errors for fear of
retribution.      T  he
Guardian articles are still available on line if you would like to read
them.    Guardian
Article One.      Guardian
Article Two  .  In
the light of Sir Nigel's public pronouncements and his history at the John
Radcliffe I therefore felt confident that the NHS Chief Executive would investigate
my case and   I wrote  to him on 23rd December
2002   pointing out that I had been dismissed in breach of my contract and
without any right of appeal.  As by the end of January I had not received the courtesy of a reply I wrote to him again on the 27th January copying my
letter to Andrew Foster Head of the Audit Commission and supplying him with
documented evidence of the wrong doing that had taken place at St George's 
and calling on Sir Nigel to set up a proper investigation and pointing out that
no one from the NHS outside of St George's had contacted me at all to offer any
assistance.  This time I did receive a reply from him but it was a disappointment.  He acknowledged the points that I had raised about having
made protected disclosures about the   cancelled
operations issue    and the   financial
balance issue   and that I had was claiming that my case had not been handled
according to the Management Code of Conduct (in giving evidence under oath at
the Employment Tribunal Catherine McLaughlin stated that the Code of Conduct was
not widely accepted within the NHS), but said that no action could be taken
before the result of my Employment Tribunal was known.  It seemed to me
that this reply was completely out of  step  with the spirit of the
remarks that Sir Nigel had made to the   Public
Administration Select Committee on 30th January 2002   in answer to   Mr
Liddel Graninger's questions   about bullying within the NHS and   Mr
Brennan's question   regarding the article   ""Silent
Pressure""   I had written for the Observer and where I had said, ""We
need to replace the targets culture with a system of intelligent
accountability"".    Sir
Nigel replied, ""Can I widen this because obviously I cannot possibly talk
about an individual case and a particular set of allegations for which there is
no evidence produced."" A quite extraordinary statement for him to make,
given that I was in correspondence with him telling him that I had written
evidence to support everything I had said and he was refusing to take any action
on it.   
 I therefore
wrote again to   Sir Nigel on the 23rd February  
this time much more forcibly pointing out that the Trust Board had not followed
either their own procedures or those of wider NHS, I pointed out that    John
Parkes   who was at the heart of the   cancelled
operations issue    had been appointed to the post of Chief Executive
while I had been thrown out of my job.  I also told him that as a result of
my investigations I
had come up with evidence of other wrong doing including quite specifically the
fact that the Director of Estates at Kings Healthcare NHS Trust was someone who
had left St George's a few years earlier following an internal audit
investigation that I had conducted which had shown him to be guilty of numerous
and serious breaches of the Trust's financial regulations.  Did Sir Nigel
live up to his public rhetoric (see  
BBC   or   House
Of Commons  )?  No he did not.  In fact he sent me a   letter
dated 27th March 2003   in which he said, ""It is my advice that for I or
the Department to try and undertake its own investigation will   muddy
the waters   prior to the
Employment Tribunal hearing and there is a risk that such an investigation may
interfere with the Tribunal's processes"".  In other words forget the rhetoric,
if you whistle blow you are on your own and have to resort to taking action in
the courts.  He also went on to say
that in relation to my claim that, ""you have received information which
illustrates wrong doing by individuals within the NHS.  However, the
information which you have provided is so vague to make it impossible for me to
comment further, or to investigate the issues should that be
necessary"".  This despite the clear statement in my letter that the
Director of Estates at Kings Healthcare NHS Trust had left his employment with
St George's directly following a period of suspension and the completion of an
adverse internal audit investigation.  Finally even
more extraordinarily his letter concluded with the sentence, ""Whether or not
the Trust chooses to recruit a particular employee or terminate the  employment
of employee, is their own decision and responsibility.  It is not
something with which I am empowered to interfere"".  Well if that is
the case how can Sir Nigel make good his promise that,   ""A
zero tolerance approach is to be introduced for managers who fiddle waiting
lists""  , when in his letter to me he states quite clearly that the
employment of managers is not something he can interfere with.      Not
satisfied with Sir Nigel's reply I communicated with him again, sending him an   e-mail
on the 31st March  .  The reply I got from Sir Nigel this time was clear
and unequivocal, ""Until that decision (Employment Tribunal) is available,
there seems to be little benefit in us rehearsing further in correspondence, the
issues we have already discussed"".   It would therefore have seemed as
if Sir   Nigel Crisp   had washed his hands of me.  However, following my
appearance on the   BBC Hardtalk   programme when I
explained to TimSebastian, what help and response I had received from Sir Nigel
Crisp surprise, surprise I received a    detailed reply from him dated 1st May
2003  , although this time the letter was addressed to Mr Perkin rather than
to Ian as had been the address used on the earlier communications from Sir
Nigel.  This time Sir Nigel changed his tack altogether saying that because
I had said it would be inappropriate for   John
Bacon the Director of Health & Social Care   to investigate the matter he
would now ask the   South West London Strategic Health
Authority   to look into the matters that I had raised.  This required me
to write to Sir Nigel again on the 6th May because I had already commenced legal
proceedings for defamation against    Melvyn Esterman   a former employee of the
South West London Strategic Health Authority and that authority was defending
those proceedings.  I explained therefore that it would be totally
inappropriate for me to supply that body with any information.  I also
supplied to Sir   Nigel Crisp    with this letter an   e-mail
dated 18th June 2001   that showed that the London Regional Office had been
party to providing a temporary loan to a health authority, with the deliberate
intention of misleading the public and Parliament in pretending that two NHS
Trusts had achieved the financial targets when in fact they had not.  Sir
Nigel sent me an    undated reply   when he suggested that the
Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland Strategic Health Authority should
look into the matters I had raised.  After receiving this letter I was told
by a member of the  St George's Board that Sir   Nigel Crisp  's proposal had
been discussed in the confidential part of the St George's May Board
meeting.  This information finally convinced me that despite his experience
at the John Radcliffe and his public pronouncements that should have meant that
I could rely on Sir Nigel's impartiality, I really could not have
any  faith in Sir Nigel Crisp acting fairly at all.  A view that was reinforced at
the Employment Tribunal when the Trust's barrister Simon Devonshire
cross-examined me on the contents of a letter I had written to Sir Nigel Crisp
and suggested that I had been making wild allegations about senior figures in
the NHS.  If you have time to read the letters I have written and posted to
this website, you can decide for yourself whether the matters raised are of serious concern
or
whether they are as Mr Devonshire suggested merely  wild allegations
designed to embarrass senior NHS officials.  In view of
Sir Nigel's behaviour I wrote to him yet again on the    27th May   requesting that
he appoint an independent QC to investigate the information that I had supplied to him.  To make sure that Sir
  Nigel Crisp   was in no doubt at all about what had gone on in relation to the
issue of Kings Healthcare NHS Trust I communicated with him again on the   8th
July   to inform him in detail of the reasons why the Kings Estates Director
had left St George's and perhaps more worryingly that a journalist Martin Halle
had told me that Kings Healthcare NHS Trust had said that St George's had given
good references for the individual concerned and that Mr Halle had tape
recorded a conversation with  
Andrew Dillon the Chief Executive of the National Institute For Clinical 
Excellence   where he had admitted that he gave that reference.   Despite
as you will  see from the   e-mail   spelling 
out in great detail the issues that should be of concern to Sir Nigel he has not
responded to me and has also not acceded to my request that an independent QC to
be appointed to investigate the matters I have raised with him.  I leave it
to you to decide if his decision is compatible with a Chief Executive of an
organisation that likes to claim that it is open and accountable and supports
whistle-blowers?  On
the Sir
Nigel also appears to be having trouble with his bed numbers.  Check out
the article published in the   Times
on Tuesday 4th November 2003.  UPDATE: 
On the evening of the   11th November 2003   I sent
Sir   Nigel Crisp   a copy of the e-mail that the   London
Evening Standard had decided to run a story   about on the 12th
November.  My last e-mail to Sir Nigel was that dated 8th July and was one
that never received the courtesy of a reply.  However, the involvement of
the media had it's usual dramatic impact on Sir Nigel and after not replying to
my   e-mail of the 8th July,   he replied to
my e-mail of the 11th November on the same day   sending
me a reply at 6.59pm.    How's that for a response, somewhat different
from the usual wait, or the not uncommon failure to reply at all.  Sir
Nigel states in his e-mail that he has already started an investigation, yet you
can see from the fact that he did not reply to my    e-mail
of the 8th July   when I asked for an independent investigation to take place
that this is a somewhat disingenuous statement for him to make.  I think
that this is a clear demonstration of what is wrong with the management of
today's NHS under Sir   Nigel Crisp  's leadership.  His  response to
being supplied with evidence of wrong doing is not to set up an independent
investigation, but is instead to do as little as possible, only changing that
strategy if and when the media make public the details of that wrong
doing.  I have e-mailed a reply to Sir Nigel and if Sir Nigel responds I will post it to this website, although because there is no immediate
media attention I will not be holding my breath for another same day
reply.    I
never received a reply to my latest e-mail to Sir Nigel sent on
12th  November 2003, instead    I received a letter dated
17th December
from Nicolas Garcia of the Department of Health   informing me on behalf of
Ministers and Sir   Nigel Crisp   that the inquiry they are prepared to countenance is an NHS internal one to be headed by David Sissling the Chief Executive of the Leicestershire, Northamptonshire and Rutland
Strategic Health Authority.  Surely given the view of managers in the
service, as evidenced by the   Jon Sudworth's
BBC Television report  ,
and the   BBC website
report   , that in achieving government targets, bullying and intimidation
within the NHS is widespread with the pressure coming from the top level. 
Having an inquiry chaired by an independent QC is the only way the public can be
truly reassured that the reporting of clinical activity against government
targets is being conducted with honesty and integrity.  I am sure you can
draw your own conclusions as to why Ministers and Sir   Nigel Crisp   are so
determined that despite the mass of evidence that there is a problem, they will
not allow an independent inquiry to take place and are anxious that the only
review that takes place is internal to the NHS thereby ensuring that they can
control the publication of its findings.    Click

  Nigel Crisp   also on Wednesday 26th November gave evidence to the Public Accounts
Committee.    Click here   to see
my comments on what he had to say about funding the NHS and   click
here   to read the e-mail I received from the National Audit Office which
supports the views I have expressed about the flaws in the calculation of HRG's
(Healthcare Resource Groups) which are used to determine by how much individual
hospitals have to reduce their spending.  You will note that Sir Nigel did
not touch on these issues when he answered the questions of the PAC.  My views
about HRG's  have
subsequently been endorsed by   the
Wandsworth Council Health Overview and Scrutiny Committee.

                 FAO
                  Director-General visits Antigua and Barbuda  
               Dr Jacques Diouf, the Director-General of the Food and Agricultural
              Organization (FAO), visited Antigua and Barbuda on 14th August
              2000.
              Dr. Diouf met with senior officials in the Ministry of Foreign
              Affairs and paid courtesy calls on His Excellency the Governor-General
              and Prime Minister Lester B. Bird.
               The Prime Minister expressed the gratitude of the government
              of Antigua and Barbuda for the assistance provided by the FAO after
              hurricane Georges. The FAO Director-General gave an overview of
              the work of his organization and promised to work closely with
              the government of Antigua and Barbuda in developing the Agricultural
              Sector.
              Dr Diouf also met the Speaker of the House, Bridget Harris, members
              of the Antigua and Barbuda Chamber of Commerce and the 10 top farmers
              of the year at a luncheon hosted by the Minister of Agriculture,

              Electoral
            Reform Bill heads for a reading in Parliament  
               The Electoral Reform Bill, which seeks to address the many amendments
              and recommendations to the Representation of the People's Act made
              by the Supervisor of Elections, the Commonwealth Observer Group,
              and by other interested parties, will be introduced to Parliament
              in September.
              The
              Bill seeks to repeal sections 3 to 42, 83 and 84 of the Representation
              of the People Act and to enact a more modern electoral system.
              An Electoral Commission is to be established consisting of five
              persons, including the chairman and two persons appointed by the
              Governor-General, acting on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.
              Two other persons appointed by the Governor-General, acting on
              the recommendation of the leader of the Opposition after consultation
              with the Prime Minister, would also be included.
              According to the Attorney-General, ""A person shall not be qualified
              to hold office as a member of the Commission if he is a Minister
              of Government, Parliamentary Secretary, a Member of Parliament,
              a candidate for election to the House of Representatives, or a
              Senator.""
              Members of the Commission shall hold office for a period of five
              years. They may be removed from office for inability to exercise
              the functions of the office, whether arising from infirmity of
              body or mind or any other cause, such as misbehaviour. The question
              of removal from office must be referred to and adjudicated by a
              specially convened tribunal.
              The Commission will have the power to direct and control the registration
              of voters and conduct elections in every constituency.
              The Commission shall, in the exercise of its functions, not be
              subject to the direction or control of any other person or authority.
              Other salient points include the qualifications for registration
              and the right to vote. The major change to this is the requirement
              that residency be established in the constituency of voting for
              at least one month prior to the calling of an election.
              On the coming into force of the Bill, the governor-general will
              appoint a date on which every qualified person shall have the right
              to apply to the registration officer to become a registered voter.
              Voter registration will be a continuous process, no longer limited
              to a period of seven days a year. Further, there is to be a total
              re-registration of all eligible voters and a new register of voters
              shall be prepared.
              Another major recommendation comes in the claims and objections
              to the voters' list. The system of hearings being held only once
              a year is to be abandoned, and will now take place once a month
              at the Magistrate's Court.
              Voter identification cards are also a major part of the Bill,
              and the Electoral Commission will be responsible for the issuing
              of such cards to all eligible voters. The cards, which must be
              used as a form of identification during elections, will include
              the picture of the bearer and the constituency in which that person
              is eligible to vote.
              The section on broadcasts states that the Electoral Commission
              may make provision in respect to the allocation of broadcasting
              time and the restriction of that time to any political party during
              a period, beginning with the publication of a notice of an election
              and ending with the declaration of the result.

                 Antigua
                  and Barbuda and US Government and Senate Representatives hold
                  talks  
              Antigua
              and Barbuda Government representatives held meetings on 8th and
              9th August in Washington with senior representatives of the US
              Treasury and the Staff of the Ranking Minority member of the US
              Senate Permanent Committee on investigations .
              The Antigua and Barbuda delegation was led by Chief Foreign Affairs
              Representative with Ministerial Rank, Sir Ronald Sanders KCN, CMG,
              and included Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
              Ambassador Colin Murdoch; Head of the Office of National Drug Control
              Policy (ONDCP) Wrenford Ferrance; and the Executive Director of
              the International Financial Services Regulatory Authority (IFSRA)
              Ms Althea Crick.
              The US Treasury team was led by William Wechsler, Special Advisor
              to the US Treasury Secretary and included Steve Kroll, Chief Legal
              Counsel and Daniel Glaser, Senior Counsel. The talks centred on
              lifting the financial advisory that the US placed on Antigua in
              April 1999. Mr Wechsler praised the government of Antigua and Barbuda
              for the significant reforms of the country's legislation on money
              laundering and the establishment of independent machinery for regulation
              and enforcement. He noted that evidence of Antigua and Barbuda's
              considerable progress was the fact that it had successfully passed
              the 25 stringent criteria laid down by the Financial Action Task
              Force (FATF), the international body charged with establishing
              global standards against money laundering and other financial crime.
              Mr Sanders told the US delegation that Antigua and Barbuda's legislation
              is among the best in the world and the test of its effectiveness
              is the full cooperation that has been given to several countries,
              including the US, in bringing criminals to justice. He noted that
              the US, the UK, Switzerland, Canada, Belgium and the Ukraine had
              all benefited from Antigua and Barbuda's work.
              The Antigua and Barbuda diplomat invited the US government to
              send a team to Antigua to see the operations of both the regulatory
              and enforcement machinery with a view to lifting the US financial
              advisory thereafter. Mr Wechsler accepted the Antigua Government
              invitation and a US team is expected in Antigua during September.
              The two delegations concluded that their discussion had been very
              helpful and informative to both sides and Mr Wechsler assured the
              Antigua and Barbuda representatives that the US had ""no intention
              of changing the objectives that had been set out when the advisory
              was put in place"". Mr Sanders thanked the US Treasury representative
              and stated that Antigua looked forward to welcoming the US team
              for a full, free and frank exchange leading to an early lifting
              of the advisory.
              The Antigua and Barbuda team also met the senior legal staff of
              Senator Carl Levin, the ranking minority member of the US Senate
              Committee on investigations. The Senate Committee is currently
              investigating correspondent banking relations between US banks
              and banks in other jurisdictions including Antigua and Barbuda.
              Mr Sanders said that the Antigua and Barbuda team has very long,
              detailed and helpful discussions with Elise J Bean and Robert L
              Roach, two senior counsels on Senator Levin's staff.
              The Antigua and Barbuda government had pledged to provide every
              assistance to the Senate Committee in its study of correspondent
              banking relations particularly in the area of financial crime.
              The Senate Committee is concerned that US banks are not diligent
              enough in their checks on banks with which they establish relations.
              For their part, the Antigua and Barbuda delegation was keen to
              demonstrate the high level of regulation applied to banks in its
              jurisdiction. Mr Sanders told the Senate team that Antigua and
              Barbuda has reduced the number of offshore banks from 72 at the
              end of 1999 to 18 today. Mr Ferrance and Ms Crick emphasized that
              both their agencies were ""vigilant and keen to root out any entity
              that abused the Antigua and Barbuda jurisdiction.""

                    Antigua consults with
                Isle of Man on OECD Harmful Tax  

               The Isle of Man has assured Antigua and Barbuda that it will
              not weaken the position of countries labelled 'tax havens' by signing
              a letter committing it to a set of standards unilaterally set by
              the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),
              High Commissioner Sir Ronald Sanders KCN, CMG, said on 17th August.
              ""The Isle of Man government representatives assured me that they
              knew nothing about a deal being close. They say they had rejected
              the OECD-dictated ""commitment"" letter and done one of their own
              which, in turn, was rejected by the OECD,"" Antigua and Barbuda's
              High Commissioner reported.
              Sanders visited the Isle of Man on 15th and 16th August. He said
              he left talks with that territory's Chief Minister Donald Gelling
              and the Treasury Minister Richard Corkill satisfied that there
              would be no weakening of the position of the countries named as
              tax-havens in their stance on the OECD.
              The High Commissioner's visit was prompted by media reports that
              the Isle of Man and the two Channel Isles, Jersey and Guernsey,
              were ""close to a deal"" with the OECD, a 29-nation grouping of rich
              nations on the matter of 'harmful taxation.""
               ""It was important for us to know whether or not the Channel Isles
              were about to do a deal with the OECD since that would weaken the
              position of the other named so-called 'tax havens,' he said.
              Most OECD-labelled 'tax-havens' are said to be vehemently opposed
              to what they see as unilateral actions by that grouping, including
              the commitment letter dictating a tax regime and process of disclosing
              information.
              The Cayman Islands and Bermuda have signed the 'commitment letter'
              and so were not listed as tax havens.
               Antigua and Barbuda wants the Isle of Man to participate in the
              Commonwealth Finance Ministers meeting in Malta September 19-21
              but because Britain would have to decide on the Isle of Man's attendance,
              Sanders said ""we have to wait to see what happens with that.""
               Following a proposal tabled by Antigua and Barbuda at last July's
              summit of Caribbean Community (CARICOM) leaders, Commonwealth Secretary-General
              Don Mc Kinnon has invited the OECD Secretariat and OECD Commonwealth
              members - Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - to meet
              the Commonwealth countries named as tax havens.
               Noting the ""identical"" position of Antigua and Barbuda, and the
              Isle of Man in continuing dialogue with the OECD aimed at finding
              a ""mutually satisfactory resolution,"" Sanders said that territory
              has agreed to continue talking and exchanging notes with Caribbean
              countries listed as 'tax havens.'
              CARICOM has designated Antigua and Barbuda as the point-country
              on issues of Financial Services.
              Along with Jersey and Guernsey, the Isle of Man makes up the third
              largest financial offshore centre in the world and, according to
              Sanders, it was important to persuade the Isle of Man to ""join
              us in working out a co-ordinated strategy.""

                       Offshore
                game operator deported  
               The manager of an offshore gaming operation, arrested four times
              in the United States for alleged narco-trafficking and who had
              recently made suspicious deposits of money into his Antigua bank
              account, was deported from Antigua on 17th August.
              The Government said that the deportation of Robert Eremain to
              Puerto Rico was not reflective of government's policy towards the ""gaming
              industry and does not reflect in any way on any licensed operators.""
              The Prime Minister's Office said that Robert Eremain, Manager
              of the Turks and Caicos-registered company, Sports Offshore, also
              worked illegally from 1997 to 17 August 2000 as he did not renew
              his work permit issued in 1996.
              ""Taking all these matters into consideration it is felt that Mr
              Eremain's continued stay in Antigua and Barbuda is not in the best
              interest of the nation,"" the government said.
              Government pointed out that a local commercial bank, in accordance
              with the requirements of the Money Laundering Prevention Act, reported
              that Robert Eremain ""had been making unusual and suspicious deposits
              into his account.""
              ""As a result, pursuant to the Money Laundering (Prevention) Act,
              an account in a commercial bank which was operated by Eremain was
              frozen by the Office of the National Drug Control programme,"" the
              statement added.
              The Prime Minister's office said a further probe by the National
              Fraud Centre of the United States revealed that the former offshore
              gaming manager was arrested on four occasions for alleged ""possession
              with the intent to distribute narcotics in the States of Connecticut,
              Maine and Massachusetts.""

                and Barbuda among 20 top flag states for shipping  
               Antigua and Barbuda has been listed among the world's 20 flag
              ship states on a ""white list"" that denotes it is a ""quality flag"" for
              shipping.
              Antigua and Barbuda's High Commissioner in London, Sir Ronald
              Sanders KCN, CMG, disclosed that the Port State Control Committee,
              the executive body of the Paris MOU, gave Antigua and Barbuda this
              rating at a recent meeting.
              Port State Control was started in 1982 when fourteen European
              countries agreed to co-ordinate their port States inspection effort
              under a voluntary agreement known as the Paris Memorandum of Understanding
              on Port State control.
              The rating given by this body is important because it determines
              how the ships of a State are regarded in the international community
              and by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO).
               In its latest report, the Paris MOU reported on 78 countries
              and Antigua and Barbuda appeared on the 'white list' in company
              with the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Japan.
              The report said, ""Quality flags can be found on the new 'white
              list' and may pride themselves on a fleet of ships with a consistently
              low detention record. These flags will also find their ships subject
              to less port State control inspections since there is evidence
              that they are capable of running a reputable register"".
               The Port State Control Committee also issued a 'black list' and
              a 'grey list'. Twenty-nine counties appeared on the 'black list'
              and were pronounced to be between medium, to very high risk. Another
              29 were on the 'grey list' indicating that they are being cautioned
              to do better.
              High Commissioner Sanders, who has overall responsibility for
              matters related to the London-based International Maritime Organization,
              paid tribute to the Antigua and Barbuda Department of Marine Services
              and Merchant Shipping in Antigua and Germany where the merchant
              ships are registered and inspected. He said ""the Department has
              produced work of a consistently high standard that has ensured
              that ships flying the Antigua and Barbuda flag enjoy a good reputation
              in the shipping industry internationally"".

                - Commonwealth Review Team appears successful   
               	The Commonwealth Review Team which visited Antigua and Barbuda
              in July appears to have achieved success in proposing a way forward
              that sets aside separation or the creation of a federal relationship.
              After almost two weeks of discussions in both islands with representatives
              of the Central Government and the Barbuda Council and with representatives
              of the private sector, trade unions, political parties and church
              organizations, the Review Team of Pierre Bienvenu and Dr Denis
              Benn proposed the creation of a joint forum of the Government and
              the Council that would meet regularly and become the agent for
              decision-making on Barbuda's development.
              The idea won acceptance from the Council leadership and Prime
              Minister Lester Bird.
              Details of how the joint forum would work are expected to be set
              out in the report of the Review Team. The Report will be submitted
              to Commonwealth Secretary-General, Don McKinnon, who will transmit
              it to the Government of Antigua and Barbuda for action by the Government
              and the Council.
              It is not clear when the Report will be submitted. However, the
              members of the Review Team are presently working on a final draft.
              Control of land on Barbuda featured prominently in the discussions
              held by the Review Team, but the issue was not in the Team's terms
              of reference since the London Constitutional Conference in 1980
              regarded the matter as settled. Nonetheless, there was general
              acceptance that the Court system in Antigua and Barbuda has provided
              a fair and objective agency for both the Barbuda Council and the
              Central Government to settle disputes that have arisen over land.

                 'Irresponsible'
                statement threatens Codrington Lagoon lobsters  
               There is a lobster rush in Barbuda, despite the fact that the
              Barbuda Council has placed a ban on lobster fishing.
               Council Chairman, Arthur Nibbs, said that the ban was enforced
              last July for a period of 18 months in order to prevent persons
              from harvesting lobsters from the Codrington lagoon.
               The ban was put in place to allow the lobsters a chance to replenish
              themselves.
               ""Unfortunately, a police official was quoted as saying that the
              Council has no authority to place a ban on the lagoon, as there
              was no by-law, and he doesn't think he could stop anyone from fishing
              in the lagoon,"" Nibbs said.
               Since the police reportedly made the statement, a number of Barbudans
              have been going to the lagoon to harvest undersize lobsters weighing
              less than a pound, Nibbs added.
               He believes that the police official acted irresponsibly and
              unprofessionally, causing the Council to lose over 10,000 lbs.
              of lobster.
               The Barbudan fishermen are reportedly paid $13 a pound for the
              lobsters they export to Guadeloupe.
               Nibbs stated that he will be working closely with the Fisheries
              Department to deal with the problem.

                 New
                airport for Barbuda awaits agreement   
               The government has proposed that a new airport should be built
              on Barbuda, but while members of the Barbuda Council are in support
              of the project they want its location changed.
              Chairman of the Council, Arthur Nibbs, says the Council members
              believe that the new facility should be built on the north-eastern
              side of the island.
              Nibbs stated that the proposal to expand the old airport would
              mean the relocation of homes in the immediate area.
              He says if the airport is built on Barbuda's north side, the taxi
              drivers operating on the island will have an opportunity to capitalize
              on the new facility.

                - Male students trailing in exam results   
               	Male students in Antigua and Barbuda continue to trail behind
              their female counterparts in the classroom.
              Education officials said this trend was discovered in the top
              61 students who were successful in the Primary Examinations thus
              enabling them to continue their education at High Schools across
              the country. 23 male students were listed in the top 61. The remaining
              38 were female.
              Jodi Browne of the Irene B. Williams School in Swetes Village,
              received the best marks in the examinations. However, Jodi is only
              one of 16 students named from Government Schools in the top 61.
              The others were from private schools. A break down shows that the
              St. Andrews School received 13 passes, the highest scored by any
              school in the top 61.
              There were 1379 students who wrote the exam with a 65% pass rate
              or a total of 909.
              Officials said that 458 students wrote the Post Primary Examinations
              with just about half of that number being successful.

                     Antigua concerned
                about conditions of students in Cuba   
               The Antigua and Barbuda government has dispatched a diplomatic
              note to the Cuban government, concerning the living conditions
              of 55 Antiguan and Barbudan students there.
              Antigua and Barbuda's non-resident Ambassador to Cuba, Colin Murdoch,
              said the students' main grouse was Cuba's planned introduction
              of a US$100 accommodation tax on private rental for each student.
               ""I have written to my counterpart asking that the Antiguan and
              Barbudan students be exempted from paying this tax,"" Murdoch said.
              If implemented, the new tax would be a ""significant dent"" to the
              US$150 allowance per student being provided by this country's Board
              of Education.
              Murdoch, in his letter to Cuba's Ambassador to the Eastern Caribbean,
              Lazaro Cabezas, also outlined a litany of other grievances faced
              by the Antiguans and Barbudans. Those included lack of access to
              telephones, alleged constant theft and matters related to the certification
              of their various disciplines of study.
              ""These are genuine concerns and we have to be sympathetic to them,"" Murdoch
              said.

                     New book depicts what
                life was like not long ago   
               	Leon ""Chaku"" Symister, an Antiguan playwright, poet, professor,
              and an attorney at law, has produced a new book of Caribbean short
              stories.
              The book is called ""Under the Calabash Tree,"" and, as Symister
              said, is intended to give Caribbean children living outside the
              region an idea of what life was like in the islands not so long
              ago.
              Symister said that he hopes the book shows Caribbean people in
              a different light; not simply depicted as smiling natives serving
              rum and coconut water to tourists on sandy beaches with blue water
              and white or pink sand.
               ""We have an indigenous culture that emerged from the intermixing
              of Africans, Europeans, Asians, and the original people of the
              islands,"" he said.
               Symister was co-founder and artistic director of the local Third
              World Theatre Group during the 70s. He produced plays such as ""Voices
              of Protest"" in 1976 and ""Tilting Scales"" in 1980.

                 Colin Derrick  , an Antigua and Barbuda lawyer, was sworn in as
              an opposition Senator on 23rd August 2000.
              Derrick replaced veteran politician Tim Hector  , whose appointment
              was revoked two months ago because he part of a government delegation
              to a United Kingdom-Caribbean conference in London.
              Derrick lost to the ALP's Gaston Browne when he contested last
              year's general elections.
               Asked the rationale for replacing Hector, a seasoned politician,
              with a relative new-comer, United Progressive Party (UPP) leader
              Baldwin Spencer said: ""Mr Derrick is a seasoned politician as well
              in the sense that he has been involved politically for a while
              albeit that he may have contested (an election) for the first time
              in 1999, but he has always been a very important part of the United
              Progressive Party.""
               Shortly after the decision by the UPP to have his senatorial
              portfolio revoked, Tim Hector accused Spencer and the rest of the
              party executive of not giving him a hearing before making a decision.
              The UPP was officially formed in 1992 out of an amalgamation of
              the rogressive Labour Movement, the National Democratic Party (NDP)
              and the Antigua Caribbean Liberation Movement (ACLM) led by Tim

                       PM
                Bird challenges West Indies Cricket Board to change its policy   
               	  Prime
              Minister Lester Bird, chairman of the CARICOM Sub-committee on
              Cricket has raised the question of the validity and sense in continuing
              the policy of the West Indies Cricket Board that only players who
              either play or make themselves available for the Domestic Busta
              Cup Tournament are eligible for selection to the W I Team.
              Bird said the recent debacles in South Africa, New Zealand and
              now England stand as testimony to the parlours state to which our
              cricket has fallen.
              The PM, in a speech to the 40th Anniversary of the Jaycees on
              the 23rd August said that we must not despair, he pointed out that: ""we
              tend to forget that the W I Cricket Team was feared and respected
              for close to three decades as they laid waste to all who challenged
              them to a contest. When we were on a winning streak, the team was
              drawn from the same reservoir of four million people in the Caribbean
              from whom they are drawn today.
              ""The reservoir,"" Bird said, ""is more than five times smaller than
              the reservoir from which Australia draws its team, six times smaller
              than Sri Lanka's, twelve times smaller than England's, thirty-two
              times smaller than Pakistan's and two hundred and thirty eight
              times smaller than India's.""
              ""Yet we beat all of them and reigned supreme for year.""
              The PM went on to say that it serves no useful purpose to denigrate
              and castigate our cricketers. What we should seek to do is to professionalize
              our system as Bob Woolmer did with South Africa when they returned
              to international cricket and as the Australians have done.
              Bird stated categorically that with our limited resource base
              we cannot afford to limit our selection to only those who play
              in our domestic championship. We have to tap all our players no
              matter where they play so long as they are playing 1st class cricket
              in any of the Test-playing countries.
              Bird further went on to say that it is ludicrous that players
              of the calibre of Vasbert Drakes, Kenny Benjamin, and Otis Gibson
              who play in South Africa should automatically be excluded as a
              result of this policy.
              We only have to point to what Jamaica did in tapping their players
              no matter where they lived or played football.
              It is instructive that Jamaica usng this policy became the first
              and only team from the English-speaking Caribbean to go to the
              Football World Cup.
              Sir   Vivian Richards   has asked Curtley Ambrose not to retire, but
              to go to Australia, otherwise we will be disgraced. Bird suggested
              that the biggest disgrace may come if Kenny Benjamin, Vasbert Drakes
              and Otis Gibson are not considered for the Australian tour and
              that this unfortunate policy will not hamper W I cricketers playing
              abroad.
              After all, Mr Bird said, why should we expect our best players
              to forego maximizing their economic potential when they are in
              their prime!
              ""The truth is that Sir   Vivian Richards  , Gordon Greenidge, Desmond
              Haynes, Andy Roberts, the late Malcolm Marshall, Courtney Walsh,
              Curtley Ambrose and many others of our great cricketers honed their
              skills in English County Cricket much to the chagrin of the English
              authorities and clearly to the benefit of West Indian Cricket and
              their excellence and dominance,"" Mr Bird said.

                    New management team
                for Antigua prison   
               	A new management team have assumed responsibility for the
              administration of the Antigua prison from August 15 following the
              expiration of the contract of the Trinidadian firm, Amalgamated
              Security Services.
              Montserrat-born Basil Walters takes over as Superintendent and
              Vincent Jackson of Antigua holds the position of Director of Corrections.
              They will be responsible for 94 prison officers and report to Dr
              Knolly Hill, who was appointed Director of Rehabilitation a few
              months ago.
              Jackson will be in charge of all administrative matters pertaining
              to correctional institutions and Walters will receive on-the-job
              training at Barbados' Glendiary Prisons.
              Veteran Barbadian Prison Officers, Granville Toppin and John Lythcott
              have been seconded to Antigua to provide training for the officers
              during the next few months.
              Walters told reporters after a symbolic handing over ceremony
              on August 11 that he was ready to make ""unpopular decisions.""
              ""There will be decisions made that will be unpopular but I am
              here to see that those decisions are carried out. Decisions of
              policy, management, structure, discipline and rehabilitation,"" he
              said.
              The new guard also shared their views on haircuts.
              ""We will not discriminate against anyone but I believe strongly
              that once you have been sent by the courts to prison you have lost
              certain rights and you must follow the rules,"" Walters said.
              Jackson agreed by saying: ""As it stands, present prison rules
              dictate that every prisoner is due a haircut.""
              Another task that will confront the new team is the issue of security,
              which has been breached twice between May and July when seven prisoners
              escaped by scaling the eastern wall. All but one were recaptured.
              ""Security is lax and we can't have people breaking out. We just
              can't have that. My plan is to make sure that this prison is secure,"" Jackson
              added.
              Apart from the breakouts, a fire destroyed a major portion of
              the facility in January, 1999.
              A commission that probed the incident recommended that a new prison
              - equipped with modern surveillance devices - be constructed.

                       Income
                Tax proposals to be amended: Private sector still unhappy   
               	Cabinet has agreed to table amendments to the Income Tax
              (Amendment) Act 2000.
              The Act was introduced in Parliament earlier this year. It seeks
              to impose a 2% tax on gross income on a monthly basis to improve
              the government's cash flow and to ensure that taxes are paid by
              all those who are liable.
              Planning Minister, Gaston Browne, says that after a meeting with
              representatives of the Chamber of Commerce, government has agreed
              to make several amendments to the law.
              Amongst the amendments would be an automatic refund mechanism
              over 12 months of any over payments of tax made when taxes are
              by all those who are liable.
              Despite this, members of the private sector are unhappy about
              the 2% tax and many have signed a document stating their refusal
              to pay. Such a refusal would be an illegal act and the perpetrators
              could be subjected to legal proceedings.   
              BACK TO TOP     

                       Ministry
                of Tourism to 'raise the profile' at upcoming summit   
               	  The
              Ministry of Tourism and Environment is to hold a tourism summit
              from 18 - 20 September under the theme ""Raising the Profile.""
              The summit is being held in an effort to heighten national awareness
              of tourism and to gain an input from stakeholders in the development
              of a national tourism plan for 2000 and beyond.
              The three-day summit will bring together tourism partners in Antigua
              and Barbuda and from across the region, who will discuss issues
              affecting the industry regionally and nationally.
              Minister Joseph said, ""It will take the format of presentations
              and panel discussions on several issues, such as marketing, product
              development, the environment, promotion, hotel development, and
              investment.""
              ""An important activity during the seminar will be the formation
              of working groups that will deliberate on critical issues impacting
              on the continued development of Antigua and Barbuda's tourism industry.
              The end result of this exercise will be the development of action
              plans and corresponding committees to address implementation,"" he
              said.

                    'A ya me born' must
                be about real pride   
               	Executive Director of the Antigua Hotels and Tourist Association.
              Cynthia Simon wants Antiguans and Barbudans to ""develop a culture
              of national pride.""
              ""...A pride not lightly, frivolously expressed in the words 'A
              ya me born' in a manner which seems to suggest 'a ya me born' so
              I do as I please, but a pride through which we express our understanding
              of respect for self, respect for others, and respect for things,"" Simon
              said. ""We, as a people, must begin to really understand and work
              to bring into being that new culture in this millennium; a culture
              of respect, value, positiveness, graciousness and finesse,"" she
              advised.
              She issued this challenge to hospitality workers at a graduation
              exercise marking the completion of the ""Excellence Together"" training
              programme, during which certificates were presented to the 107
              participants.
              The evening's programme was in keeping with the theme of the training
              exercise: An Evening of Excellence.
              The feature address was delivered by Tourism Minister Molwyn Joseph,
              with greetings and comments from Casmin Knowles, the local representative
              of American Express, co-sponsors of the training programme.
              The second annual ""Excellence Together"" training programme formed
              part of the AH&TA's agenda for this year. The year 2000 has been
              designated by the tourism association as the Year of Human Resource
              Development for Hospitality Industry Workers.
