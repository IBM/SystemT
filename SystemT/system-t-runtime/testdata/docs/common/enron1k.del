1,"Hey there Bill!

I thought I'd drop a quick line just to do a quick introduction of myself.
Your buddy, Brendan, has offered your tour guide ability to me when I visit
Portland in July.  I do have a college friend out there (who I hope to
locate) so you might not have to be stuck with me. :)

Anyhow I'm Nikki.  I'd go more into depth but everytime I write it out it
sounds more like a personal add then an introduction!

Brendan tells me you are about to close on a condo.  Congratulations!  I
can't wait to have a place of my own!  Apartment life is horrible.  My
neighbor and I knock on the bathroom wall at each other in the mornings just
to say ""hi"".  I'm really serious.  I actually have really great neighbors in
my building and I have to admit, apartment life is a good way to get to know
people.

I don't know what Brendan has told you about me but here's the story.  I was
born and raised in New Mexico and hate it here!  I need trees and green!
Someone once compared landing in New Mexico to landing in a litter box.
Where there's not dirt there's piles of crap.  Now everytime a plane flies
me back home I look around and agree.

So, to say the least I'm a little stir crazy for a new environment.  The
first part of August I will be moving to Newport Beach, California.  Or one
of four other beach communities in that area.  I want to experience that
whole lifestyle for at least a year.  Then I'm moving to Oregon.  I've never
visited or anything I'm just drawn there.  To be perfectly honest it's
because of the two movies ""Goonies"" and ""Kindergarten Cop"".  I loved those
movies as a kid and have wanted to move to Astoria ever since.  Now's my
chance.  I just finished college and have a period of resting time before I
go after my master's in Public Health Administration or my MBA.  We'll see
which fits me best later.  I don't feel that at 24 I can really decide the
""best"" avenue for the next 50 years of my career so I'm waiting for the life
experience to kick in and lead the way later.

As of yet I have no set plans as to dates, iteneraries, etc and so forth.
I'm a very spontaneous type of person I don't really ""do"" planning and
scheduling.  I just kind of show up and try to make my own fun.  It's better
that way.  Life can be too organized!

Well now that I've given you a ""short"" introduction...haha.  I'd love to
hear back from you about any conflicting dates that you might have in July.
Don't worry if they change I won't hold ya to them.  The only time that I am
forecasting for myself is the 12th through the 16th (of July) IF I don't go
to Calgary, Canada.  Currently I'm planning as many trips as I possibly can.
My youth is fading fast and I need to enjoy as much of it as I possible
while I don't have a husband and kids to take care of. :)

Hope to hear from you soon!
Nikki

5,"A quick reminder for the newer members of the group.  The bottom of the El Paso model is divided into five different regions.  Prescheduled sales, real time sales, then prescheduled purchases, real time purchases and finally ancillary services.  Each group of purchases, sales and ancillary services need to be seperate.  The purchases and sales should each pull in to the summary portion at the bottom of the model.  Likewise the ancillary services should pull into the blue ancillary service summary section.  Kathy at El Paso and/or those on shift the next day are having to correct mistakes with these formulas.  As always, if you have questions regarding the El Paso model, please ask a more experienced member of the group or myself.  Otherwise, mistakes on simple formulas should be expected not to happen.

Thanks,
Bill"
6,"Bill,
Thank you so much for writing back to me. I have been missing you like crazy without any way of getting in touch with you.  How are things going?  We have so much catching up to do.  I realize more than ever what a special friend you are and how much I have missed our conversations.  I hope all is going wonderful with you.  Things here are great.  I am almost done with my second year of school (only 2 more weeks)  I just took a comprehensive exam over the last 2 years and I think I passed.  I am constantly amazed that I am almost done with school and will soon be practicing medicine on poor innocent people.  I'll actually be in Seattle all of August and September, so hopefully we can arrange some kind of meeting so I can give you a big hug.
How is work?  Are you still doing the same job?  I know last time we talked you had all kinds of crazy ideas floating around about moving to Europe or Japan or something crazy like that.  In fact, that is what I thought had happened and I was so scared that i would not be able to find you.  Do you still have your wonderful motorcycle?  I know you were moving to a new home the last time we talked, but I know nothing about it.  are you living by yourself, in a condo, a home, an apartment?  Anything else wild and crazy that I have missed hearing about?  I'm sure there is....
Well, I just had to check something quickly off the internet before class today, and unfortunately I must go.  But it was wonderful to see your name and hear that you are alive and well.  I will definately be calling you this week to catch up.
I have missed you my friend, take care,
Sara

Thank you for returning the paperwork to me. They are installing hardwoods
on 4th floor right now. (I was down there this am). The Lobby is
complete...just some touch up needed. Elevator is up & running.

At this time, we need you to identify a Lender and get yourself pre-approved
and have the Lender pre-approve the project. Because it is a conversion,
some Lenders have trouble doing the loan. Jerry Wilson of Pacific Northwest
Mortgage, Inc. has pre-approved this project and is doing a number of other
loans at the Roosevelt.
In case you'd like his number it is: 503-224-4564 or pager 503-224-4308
(Tell him you are calling re: Roosevelt).

Let me know which Lender you are working with and I will give them the
necessary info about the building.

34,"Group,

Going forward we will be transacting with Enron Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis.  We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for non-firm energy trades.  Enron Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possibilities for export and import.  We should be familiar with the Alberta Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD.  The lead or NW trader will provide Enron Canada with their estimate or feel of the market each morning and throughout the day.

Enron Canada will be trying to obtain non-firm transmission nearly every hour.  WE need to tell them if this is an unwise practice from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, as they will lose around $7 per mw (CDD) on unused transmission with zero chance for return.

Further, Enron Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.  They will give us the first look, but if we cannot use their energy, they will contact WWP, IPC, TransAlta or other counterparty in an attempt to recoup some of their loss.  I do not see a need for this and I think it leaves us open to tainted customer relationships, financial loss, and embarrassment.  If we are in contact with Enron Canada before the fact (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.  Be very clear in your dealings with NW counterparties that you are buying or selling a non-firm product.  Determine a book-out price to solve problems with physical flow if necessary.  We are basically buying a put or a call and should pay our counterparty appropriately.

Finally, I would like to see improved communication with Enron Canada.  It appears we have limited our contacts within our own company and hindered the flow of information to both parties' detriment.  I feel we can do better.  I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Enron Canada and Enron North America.  This is counterproductive for both parties for obvious reasons.  Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with Enron Canada.  This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that can only be beneficial.  If you have questions or ideas regarding our relationship with Enron Canada, please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill"

Enron Global LNG
Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world's growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels.   Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for Enron's wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market.

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization.

Location:		2WTC Oregon Room

Other items:	Course materials provided at start of class
Breakfast and Lunch will be provided both days

Course Description
This course builds on our Applied Energy Derivatives program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective.  Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring / marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.  Applied Energy Derivatives, or its equivalent is a prerequisite for this program; no other advanced preparation is required.  CPE Credits: Accounting & Auditing 2; Consulting Services 1; Management 1; Specialized Knowledge & Applications 12.

At the conclusion of this course, participants will be able to:
Decipher the role of the price curve, volatility, and time in determining the intrinsic value and time value of an option premium
Understand how a dealer 'trades volatility' and dynamically hedges an option
Recognize the limitations of traditional option pricing models when applied to energy
Annualize a periodic (e.g. monthly) volatility and vice versa
Create synthetic puts and calls using put-call parity to exploit mispriced options
Incorporate volatility term structures, ""smiles and skews"", in analyzing deals
Establish a delta-neutral hedge of an option and calculate the cost of changing prices on that hedge position
Comprehend the relationship between gamma and actual price volatility and its consequent implications for a dealer's earnings
Anticipate the irregular changes in gamma by stress testing option portfolios, thereby allowing more informed position management
Interpret an aggregated risk management report for an option portfolio and the positive or negative values for delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho
Structure an option on a swap to create innovative hedges for customers
Create extendable and cancelable fixed price deals
Embed a swaption sale to create sub-index physical supply to a user
Compare the merits and earnings opportunities among various alternatives available to a customer seeking to reverse an existing swap position
Determine the cash value of a swap terminated before its end date
Apply swaps with off-market fixed prices to monetize value in existing contracts or to provide for the cash/borrowing needs of a customer
Combine off-market swaps in complex structures: e.g. ""blend-and-extend"""

Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including holiday parties, post-quarterly meeting outings, and going away parties. While I hope that people thoroughly enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act professionally and responsibly during and after these events. I have been working with Chris Calger and Amy FitzPatrick to put together some guidelines for company-sponsored social events:

The company will provide soft drinks, beer and wine. You may choose to order other beverages at your expense.
Functions will run for a specified period of time. If there is an open bar, we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any additional drinks.
If you require assistance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked. The last thing in the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the safety of others in jeopardy.

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available.

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South ,
The Sky Ring
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge)."

DAILY BRIEFING -- Can UBS Tame Enron's Wild Traders?
Daily Briefing: NEWS ANALYSIS
By Emily Thornton in New York, David Fairlamb in Zurich, and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas
Back in November, Dynegy (NYSE:DYN <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=dyn&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/d/dyn.html>) had what sounded like a great idea: Buy Enron's flagship trading business in natural gas and electricity, and immediately become the dominant force in those markets. Dynegy fled when Enron started to collapse under an avalanche of scandal. Now, Zurich [Switzerland]-based UBS Warburg (NYSE:UBS <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ubs&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ubs.html>) is making the same bet, albeit for a lot less money.
The question now: Will the conservative bank be able to impose Swiss order on the rogue Texas company's traders? On one level, the deal doesn't seem completely farfetched. Enron's gas and electricity trading actually seems to have made money. Other bankers who checked it out estimate the trading operations racked up $3 billion in pretax profits over the past two years [see BW, 2/11/02, ``Enron: How Good an Energy Trader?''].
Still, UBS had good reason to go for a deal that gave it 67% of future pretax profits for a pledge only to pay the salaries of 625 Enron employees. Obviously, the Enron name is mud, and getting people to trade with the company will be difficult enough. But managing Enron's swaggering traders -- its core asset -- could turn out to be even harder.
CULTURE CLASH. Enron may be on its last legs, but its masters-of-the-universe culture lives on, say insiders. ``Even after going down in flames, a lot of these people have undiminished confidence in their ability,'' says a former Enron trader who asked not to be named. Competitors doubt that people who earned as much as $1 million a year in the freewheeling, high-risk Enron culture will be grateful to become a small piece of UBS's massive fixed-income business.
Although many have signed contracts with UBS that prevent them from leaving Enron for an undisclosed period, ``they're all exploring their options,'' says one banker privately. Indeed, some traders are talking about trying to buy the trading unit back from UBS after it gets going again. UBS says it's not worried about rogue traders. ``We're confident in the people we have hired,'' says Michael Hutchins, global co-head of credit fixed income at UBS Warburg.
For the scheme to work, however, UBS must persuade Enron's traders to accept its risk-management practices. And that will be tough: One reason Enron's traders made so much is that they took big risks. Analysts estimate that Enron was willing to put as much as $66 million at risk on a trade, vs. $12.2 million at Dynegy or $16 million at Duke Energy. UBS Warburg is willing to put up to $131 million at risk in all of its deals with a single trading partner, but insiders says its energy traders won't be allowed to risk ``anything like that'' on a single trade. UBS'ers abide by tighter controls than at Enron.
``SMOOTHING ELEMENT.'' UBS officials insist that they have no rosy delusions about the investment. That's partly because they had been researching the energy-trading business for more than a year as a way of diversifying the bank's trading income. ``Earnings in the energy-trading business do not depend on developments in the capital markets, so they could work as a smoothing element,'' says UBS President Peter A. Wuffli.
That's in fact what motivated UBS to send a small team down to Houston when Enron put the business up for sale after the bankruptcy filing. Even after federal antitrust authorities give the final go-ahead, the Swiss bank says it plans to take things slowly. ``We don't know how quickly this is going to start up,'' says UBS CEO John Costas. ``We'd be happy in the first year if this business is half as big as it had been historically.''
Still, anything associated with Enron is arguably fraught with risk at any price. ``It's not clear how successful UBS is going to be,'' says Jeff Dietert, an analyst at investment bank Simmons & Co. in Houston. ``And I think UBS knows that. That's why it wasn't willing to pay anything up front.''
Some industry insiders doubt that Enron's traders will prove to be exceptional under the new rules. But UBS isn't about to change its own way of doing business. ``Entering into energy trading does not mean extending our appetite for risk,'' says Wuffli. Swiss family Enron? Don't bet the chalet on it.

Take the Money and Run

Peak power prices for Wednesday delivery were mostly steady across the West
on Tuesday, largely due to a stagnant spot gas market and near-normal
temperatures.  ""Prices were trading in very narrow ranges at most of the
hubs today, and that made for a lackluster session,"" complained one
marketer.  NYMEX Henry Hub contracts for the front months closed lower on
Tuesday despite cold Northeast temperatures, likely due to more moderate
forecasts for next week, and on some technical selling.  March slipped 4.3
cents to close at 2.074$/mmBtu, while April shed 3.2 cents to end at
2.152$/mmBtu.  Most 2003 and 2004 contracts finished up slightly.  The EIA
recently said that it expects U.S. natural gas inventories to end the first
quarter at a record 1.46 tcf.  The low point for U.S. gas stocks at the end
of the winter heating season has averaged about 920 bcf over the past eight
years.  Weekly draws of 144 bcf would be needed over the nine remaining
weeks of withdrawl season to lower inventories to a more normal 1.0 tcf.
Not a likely scenario since draws for the nine-week period have averaged 63
bcf over the past five years.  In other industry news, lawyers for Ken Lay
have refused to accept a subpoena from a congressional committee requiring
his appearance at public hearings.  Mr. Lay's lawyers said they did not know
their client's whereabouts and could not accept any subpoenas on his behalf.
Peggy Peterson, a spokesperson for the House financial services committee
said, ""He [Lay's lawyer] tells us he does not know of Lay's whereabouts,
which we find quite puzzling to say the least.  Even if Lay is forced to
appear by a subpoena, many parties believe he would likely plead the Fifth
and not testify.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were steady to slightly higher than
levels reported a day ago.  Amid continuing cold overnight temperatures,
light load goods traded slightly higher, and in a narrower range.  Flow
forecasts for Chief Joseph were little changed, coming in at 110 kcfs
Wednesday and Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday,
115 kcfs Monday, and 110 kcfs next Tuesday.  No news was good news on the
unit front Tuesday, with no new significant outages reported.  According to
Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was forecast to average
115 percent of normal through February 12, with the greatest demand expected
during the latter part of that period.

With little news, close-to-normal temperatures, and steady spot gas prices
at the SoCal border, day-ahead electricity prices edged up slightly in the
Golden State on Tuesday.  Heavy load transactions at NP15 went through from
24.25 up to 26.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done in the 24.25 to
24.75$/MWh range and the high end reached late.  Light load goods maintained
their recent strength, trading from 20.25 to 21.5$/MWh.  NP15
balance-of-February saw action around 22.75 to 23.25$/MWh.  ""I think some
traders had the March jitters, light and heavy firmed up some there today,""
commented one California player.  SP15 off-peak saw the most strength on
Tuesday, with deals going through as high as 22.95$/MWh for Wednesday
delivery.  There was little change in the generation landscape on Tuesday.
Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) returned to service from a maintenance outage that
began February 2.  Alamitos #3 (320 MW) ramped up to 240 MW, on its way back
from an outage that began January 26.  Forecasts for Wednesday called for
highs at southern load centers to reach the mid-60s, down slightly from
Tuesday's levels, with overnight lows in the upper-40s.  The state capital
anticipated a high of 58 degrees and a low of 36 degrees.  The most current
six-to-ten from the NWS predicted normal temperatures from February 11 to
15.

In the Southwest, peak power prices for Tuesday delivery were flat to
slightly lower to a day ago as weather conditions in cities such as Phoenix
were described as ""beautiful, sunny, and in the 70s.""  Heavy load energy at
Palo Verde ranged from 22.5 to 23.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed trades heard as
high as 24$/MW.  Mead commanded a premium to PV, but most of that energy was
reportedly bound for the Golden State.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (395 MW)
returned to full power Tuesday, following tube leak repairs that began back
on January 25.  Meanwhile, Coronado #2 (385 MW) slipped into a planned
maintenance outage slated to last until February 10.  Weather Derivatives
forecast heating demand in the desert region to average a mere 85 percent of
normal through February 10, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
calling for mostly normal temperatures from February 11 through 15.

___________________________________________________________
Amid cold temperature forecasts, particularly in SERC, peak power prices
rose across the Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday.  ""It was good to see some
strength in the dailies, however short-lived it may be,"" said one Cinergy
player.  Firmer prices were seen in Balance-of-February and the March/April
contracts as well, despite another lackluster day in gas.  NYMEX Henry Hub
futures edged down again on Tuesday.  March fell 4.3 cents to close at
2.074$/mmBtu, while April lost 3.2 cents to end at 2.152$/mmBtu.

Amid much higher real-time prices, peak electricity prices edged up just
slightly in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.  Western PJM goods for Wednesday
delivery were bought and sold between 24.75 and 25.75$/MWh.  Traders mostly
expected prices to drop off with warmer forecasts for the end of the week.
LMPs reached a lofty high of 115$/MWh early Tuesday morning, but averaged
35.09$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures were expected to warm into
the mid-40s on Wednesday and continue there through Saturday.  The latest
six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 11 to 15.

With unit outages and winter weather, heavy load energy costs made robust
gains in the Midwest on Tuesday, to the delight of sellers.  ""People have
really found their faith today.  Balance-of-Feb was up over a buck and
March/April surged a bit as well,"" crowed one trader.  Into Cinergy edged up
all day, trading between 22.75 and 26$/MWh, while Balance was heard from
21.1 to 21.35$/MWh and March/April saw action up to 21.25$/MWh.  Power
sellers were concerned with the higher transmission rates they were seeing
from the newly operating MidwestISO on Tuesday.  ""I'm seeing a base rate of
4$/MWh, and if you add in ancillary costs of 50 cents and recovery of old
costs at 2.5$/MWh, transmission is costing nearly 7$/MWh, compared to about
4$/MWh before.  That's going to hamper movement in and out of Cinergy, and
increase volatility in the market,"" predicted one in-the-know seller.  In
unit news, sources said Beaver Valley #2 (833 MW) has been off-line since
February 4.  Traders also said Cook #2 could be back as early as February
16, while the Rockport unit (1,300 MW) was expected to remain down into
mid-March.  High temperatures were predicted to warm slightly into the
upper-30s for Wednesday, and the most current six-to-ten continued to
forecast above-normal temperatures from February 11 to 15.

Bullish weather conditions sent day-ahead electricity prices higher in the
Southeast and Texas on Tuesday.  ""I saw some buyers today that have been out
of the market for a while,"" commented one SERC player.  Into TVA on-peak
pieces traded from 23 to 25$/MWh, with off-peak pieces equally strong from
16 to 19$/MWh.  Unlike northern hubs, Entergy dealers reported a weaker
balance-of-the-month market on Tuesday.  Wednesday forecasts called for well
below-normal temperatures across SERC and Texas, with highs mostly in the
mid-30s to mid-40s.  The mercury was expected to climb into normal territory
by Saturday and the up-to-date six-to-ten predicted above-normal
temperatures from February 11 to 15.

213,"Bill,

Everything went smooth last night and this morning with El Paso and the ramps.  Due to the migration I am unable to send the EPE model to Kathy (file for Feb. did not pull into the M: drive).   I was also unable to get into CAPS (Trading cluster is not reconfigured).  I saved the model through my shift and now that I have logged off I am unable to log back on under my name.  I updated Geir's login last night (upon his request) and have limited access through his login.  Holden is aware of these problems.

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery were slightly lower across the
Western U.S. on Monday, unquestionably the result of less weather-related
demand.  ""Temperatures are forecast to be normal to slightly above-normal
through the week in most regions, so we're feeling pretty bearish right
now,"" commented one marketer.  A late-session rally for off peak power was
reported at the Mid-Columbia, but most players believed that one or two
parties must have been caught a little bit short given the mild weather and
abundant supplies.  Heating demand in the WSCC was only expected to average
94 percent of normal through February 11, and the latest six-to-ten-day
forecast was calling for mostly normal temperatures from February 10 through
14.  In other industry news, former Enron CEO Ken Lay told Congress on
Sunday that he would refuse to testify before two committees preparing to
hear his testimony.  As a result, the Senate Commerce Committee cancelled
Monday's hearing at which Mr. Lay was to have been the sole witness.  The
Senate Commerce Committee said it would meet Tuesday morning to subpoena Mr.
Lay.  Senator Byron Dorgan, the North Dakota Democrat who heads the
committee's consumer affairs subcommittee, said, ""We decided that we really
had no choice but to issue a subpoena to require his attendance.""  Mr.
Dorgan said he had been assured by some Republicans on the Commerce
Committee that they would vote in favor of a subpoena.

Tuesday's heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell slightly from levels
seen for Monday as regional temperatures had begun to moderate.  A late-day
rally occurred in the light load arena when some shorts reportedly entered
the market.  ""There wasn't a whole lot of activity for the off peak when the
session began, but later on it just shot up,"" said one Oregon-based utility
trader.  Heating demand in the region was forecast to pick up over the
coming weekend, rising to an average of 121 percent of normal next Sunday
and Monday.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward on Monday,
coming in at 110 kcfs through Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday,
60 kcfs Sunday, and 115 kcfs next Monday.  There were a few goings on in the
generation landscape Monday.  Bridger #1 (520 MW) was back in service, but
Bridger #3 and #4 (520 MW each) were brought down so engineers could perform
some ""boiler unplugging.""  The Wyoming-based units were both expected to
return to service sometime on Thursday.

Amid stagnant gas values and slightly below-normal temperatures, power
prices settled lower in the Golden State on Monday.  ""I think prices will
trend down this week, with the warmer weather,"" commented one California
player.  Heavy load goods at NP15 changed hands between 24 and 24.75$/MWh,
with unconfirmed trades heard as high as 26$/MWh.  Light load pieces were
bought and sold from 19.75 to 21$/MWh.  NP15 Balance-of-February was heard
near 23.25$/MWh.  Of hydroelectric interest, the California DWR listed
snow-water equivalents in the northern section of the state at 111% of
normal.  Spot gas values at the Socal border remained flat to Friday levels,
between 2.13 and 2.18/$mmBtu.  In unit news, gas-fired Alamitos #4 (480 MW)
returned to the grid on Monday, and Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) went down for
planned maintenance on Saturday.  On the weather front, Tuesday forecasts
called for highs to reach 70 degrees in L.A. and 58 to 61 degrees at
mid-state load centers.  Overnight lows were anticipated in the mid-30s to
mid-40s.  The five-day outlook predicted little change through Friday.  The
most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from February 10 to
14.

With Phoenix forecast to see daytime highs in the 70s and overnight lows in
the 50s through the week, day-ahead electricity prices headed lower in the
Southwest on Monday.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 23 to 24.25$/MWh
an average decline of 1$/MWh from levels reported for Monday.  Mead
commanded a premium to PV, with several players stating that the
higher-priced electricity was bound for the California market.  In unit
news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) was operating at 260 megawatts on Monday, but was
still having trouble ramping all the way to full power.  Meanwhile, Coronado
#2 (385 MW) was scheduled to come down early Tuesday for some planned
maintenance slated to last until February 10.  The latest six-to-ten from
the NWS was calling for above-normal temperatures in eastern New Mexico and
normal temperatures everywhere else from February 10 through 14.

___________________________________________________________
As the expected colder temperatures materialized across the Eastern
Interconnect, peak power prices appreciated on Monday.  With the exception
of Texas, which tanked on low gas values, heavy load goods changed hands
firmly in the 20s everywhere.  Maintenance outages also contributed to the
bullish tenor of the day.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures slipped on
Monday, with March falling 2.1 cents to close at 2.117$/mmBtu.  April also
edged down a comparatively mild 1.4 cents to end at 2.184$/mmBtu.

Amid much stronger load forecasts and colder temperatures expected for
Tuesday, heavy load energy costs rose in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.
Western PJM pieces were bought and sold in a narrow range from 24.9 to
25.3$/MWh.  LMPs bounced up and down three times in the late morning and
early afternoon on Monday, and averaged 22.38$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  On
the generation front, sources gave Keystone #2 (850 MW) a revised expected
off-line date of February 8.  The unit was reportedly slated to undergo 20
days of maintenance.  High temperatures were expected in the upper-30s on
Tuesday, and predicted in the low-40s by the end of the workweek.  The most
current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 10 to
14.

Traders in the Midwest characterized the dailies as a ""wild ride"" on Monday,
with heavy load electricity prices strengthening considerably on the
aggregate.  ""Cinergy opened near 20, climbed to 22.5, came off, and leapt up
all the way to 24$/MWh at the end,"" said one Cinergy commentator on the day
after the Super Bowl.  While the dailies changed hands from 20 to 24$/MWh on
Monday, market players said the bulk of deals were seen around 21.5$/MWh.
Balance-of-February trades were heard between 20.25 and 20.5$/MWh.  In unit
news, Quad Cities #2 (789 MW) was off the grid for refueling and pump
repairs on Monday, with a tentative ETR of March 11.  Sister unit #1 (821
MW) was in start-up.  Fellow nuke LaSalle (1,144 MW) was also in start-up at
25% late Monday, and expected at full by mid-week.   Temperatures were
slightly colder than anticipated by Friday forecasts, with highs across ECAR
in the mid-30s and lows in the low-20s.  The outlook called for slight
warming, into the low-40s by Thursday, and the latest six-to-ten called for
above-normal temperatures from February 10 to 14.

The Southeast saw some strength on Monday as daily power prices responded to
the colder forecasts.  Into TVA day-ahead peak power prices were heard from
21 to 24$/MWh, with the low end reached late and the bulk of deals done in
the 22 to 22.25$/MWh range, according to traders.  Balance contracts into
TVA were heard trading between 20 and 20.15$/MWh.  Texas electricity prices
weakened on gas, with transactions heard between 18.5 and 19.35$/MWh.  ERCOT
balance-of-the-month saw action mostly from 18 to 18.6$/MWh.  Tuesday
forecasts called for temperatures well below normal across both regions,
with highs expected in the mid-40s.  SERC lows were forecast to drop into
the low-20s.  The most up-to-date six-to-ten predicted above-normal
temperatures from February 10 to 14.

226,"Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.

In a press release, Ken said, ""I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal.""

He added, ""My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."""

229,"MARKET NOTICE
February 4, 2002

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) is announcing the
Aggregated Distributed Generation Pilot Project (ADGPP).  The participation
of Generating Units in the ISO's markets is currently limited to units with
a rated capacity of 1 MW or greater.  The ADGPP is intended to demonstrate
the feasibility of allowing physically separated small units (less than 1
MW) to be aggregated as a means of reducing barriers to entry into the ISO
markets.  ADGPP is currently intended to operate as follows:

*	Generation units with a rated capacity of less than 1 MW may
participate
*	Generators will be aggregated through an Aggregated Distributed Unit
(ADU), which will have an aggregated or total rated capacity greater than or
equal to 1 MW but no more than 10 MW
*	The total capacity for all units participating in this Pilot Project
is limited to 50 MWs
*	ADUs must contain generators that are in the same Demand Zone which
are not on opposite sides of constrained transmission elements
*	Each ADU must be scheduled in the ISO Energy or Supplemental Energy
Market
*	Near real-time operational data will be required from ADU
*	Prospective participants can propose unique methods and processes
for delivering the near real time operational data
*	Generators will be considered SC Metered Entities, therefore they
must have Local Regulatory Authority approved interval metering
*	Settlement will occur through submitting aggregated Settlement
Quality Meter Data (SQMD) by the SC representing the ADU

As noted above, units participating in the ADGPP will be allowed to
participate in the ISO Energy and Supplemental Energy Markets only and will
not be allowed to participate in the ISO's Ancillary Services markets.  The
increased participation in the ISO Energy and Supplemental Energy markets
will provide greater market depth and will increase competition by expanding
the pool of generation available within the ISO Control Area.  The ADGPP is
intended only to accommodate units less than 1 MW and is not intended to
facilitate ""portfolio bidding"" from Generating Units 1 MW or larger.

The ADGPP is also intended to improve the ISO's visibility of generating
resources within the ISO Control Area by demonstrating the functionality of
various basic-level operational data reporting processes which may be
proposed by the prospective participants.  These operational data reporting
processes should demonstrate the capability of delivering operational data
for the ADU to the ISO near real time and be economical from the small
Generator perspective.  The uniqueness of the operational data reporting
processes proposed will be one factor in selection of participants in the
program.  Thus, the project will also ensure that the participation of these
resources in the ISO's markets will occur without compromising system
reliability.

The ISO will be hosting a Workshop on Friday, March 8th to discuss the Pilot
Project details.  Please contact Sue Happ (916) 608-7059 for reservations.
Participation in the workshop will only be allowed if reservations are made
in advance.

Workshop Objectives:

Members of the ISO staff from Metering, EMS, IT Security, Operations and
Market Services will be available to provide a general description of the
Pilot Program and to answer any questions from prospective participants.  An
agenda and directions to the workshop will be provided on March 1st.

Workshop Target Audience:

Aggregators, Scheduling Coordinators and Prospective Generators.

The ISO will allocate two hours on the agenda to interested Aggregators or
Scheduling Coordinators.  If you are interested in providing a presentation,
please Contact Ali Miremadi at (916) 608-7061 by February 22nd

233,"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

234,"Attached for your review are the finalized versions of the ISO Statement
Files Specification (v14.0), ISO Charge Matrix (v14.0 ) and overview
documents describing the key changes.  Draft versions of the same documents
were distributed in January for your review and comments.  Version 14.0 is
created due to changes in two settlement areas:
*	The existing Market Operations Charge (CT 523) will be replaced by
the new Ancillary Services and Real Time Energy Operations Charge (CT 524).
*	To facilitate automatic processing of Manual Line Item entries by
the SCs, ISO will impose more rigorous validations upon these entries when
they are created in the ISO Settlement System.

The above changes are scheduled to take effect on trade date 1/1/2002.  The
additional changes in the finalized versions are mostly minor corrections
and clarifications.

ISO has also added two new Manual Charge Types (CTs 691 and 692) in the
Charge Matrix:
CT 691 - Emissions Cost Payment; and
CT 692 - Start-Up Cost Payment.

These Charge Types were created as a result of the FERC's Order (dated
6/19/01) to reimburse generators for their Emissions and Start-Up related
costs incurred as a result of ISO dispatch.

Please send your questions and comments to Mr. C. P. Ng via email
(cng@caiso.com).  Thank you.

Task Force Taken to Task

Western heavy load energy costs for Monday delivery were mostly steady from
levels reported for the Friday/Saturday package as weather forecasts called
for warmer weather in the new week and spot gas prices remained relatively
stable.  Meanwhile, off-peak prices were largely stronger due to the
inclusion of the all-day Sunday piece.  According to Weather Derivatives,
heating demand in the WSCC was expected drift lower through the new week,
averaging only 96 percent of normal through February 8.  Additionally, the
latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting mostly normal temperatures
across the Western U.S. from February 7 through 11.  In other industry news,
a federal judge has ordered Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force
to explain the constitutional arguments behind its refusal to release
details of its meetings last year, which included executives from Enron
Corp. and other large energy firms.  The Bush administration has so far
refused to release details such as the names of people it consulted and the
subjects discussed in drafting George W's energy policy.

Peak power in the Pacific Northwest was little changed for Monday delivery
as forecasted normal temperatures continued to whittle away at heating
demand, though regional demand was expected to remain slightly above normal
through the new week.  While flow forecasts for the Columbia River were
downgraded slightly on Friday, they appeared to be more than ample enough to
satiate regional demand.  Flows at Chief Joseph were forecast to be 75 kcfs
Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 105 kcfs Monday, and 100 kcfs Tuesday through
Friday.  In unit news, Bridger #4 (520 MW) returned to the grid following
repairs to a plugged boiler that began on Wednesday, but Bridger #1 (520 MW)
slipped into the off-line category for tube leak repairs that were expected
to end on Sunday.  The return date for Colstrip #3 (700 MW) was reportedly
pushed back until February 10.  Utah-based Hunter #1 (446 MW) was scheduled
to come down for 24 hours of repairs beginning around midnight on Friday.
On a side note, BPA said Friday that it expects electricity customer McCook
metals to restart partial production at its idled Longview, Washington
aluminum smelter after a new ""take-or-pay"" contract kicks in on April 1.
Several regional smelters agreed to halt all aluminum production back in
March 2001 due to the electricity supply crunch in the Pacific Northwest.
Several analysts, however, were skeptical as to whether any smelters in the
region would be restarted this year.

With little change in the generation landscape, flat spot gas prices at the
SoCal border, and normal temperature forecasts for the new week, electricity
prices remained steady in the Golden State on Friday.  Light load prices
appreciated again on Friday, boosted by the all-day Sunday inclusion and
recent trends.  Heavy load pieces at NP15 traded between 24 and 27$/MWh, and
light load deals were done from 21.5 to 23.75$/MWh, picking up by more than
buck on both ends.  In political news, PG&E released the asset and debt
breakdown for its proposed spin-off companies.  In their plan, a generating
company would have $5.3 billion in assets and assume $2.4 billion in debt.
An electric transmission company would be valued at $1.6 billion and take on
$1.1 billion in debt.  Lastly, a gas transmission company would have assets
of $1.4 billion and assume $900 million in debt.  However, U.S. bankruptcy
judge Montali has not yet ruled on PG&E's reorganization plan, and for
fracturing of the utility to move forward, the SEC's approval would also be
required.  In unit news, hydro Big Creek Project PSP (1,020 MW) was only
down 150 MW, while gas-burner Alamitos #5 (480 MW) came off the grid for
planned maintenance.  California weather forecasts called for gradual
warming over the weekend, leading temperatures into just below-normal
territory for the early part of the new week.  Highs for Monday and Tuesday
were expected near 70 degrees in Los Angeles, while northern load centers
anticipated highs near 58 degrees.  The most current six-to-ten called for
normal temperatures from February 7 to 11.

Peak power prices in the Southwest were largely steady for Monday delivery,
but some late-day selling caused prices to end near session lows.  Heavy
load energy costs at Palo Verde ranged from 23.75 to 25.5$/MWh, with
unconfirmed deals as low as 22$/MWh reported about an hour after the normal
trading session had ended.  ""It's still supposed to be cold to start the new
week, but the worst of it is certainly over, or so our in-house forecasters
say,"" said one Phoenix-based trader.  Some traders believed unit outages
could keep supplies a bit tight to start the new week, but that forecasted
warming would keep most strength at bay.  Coronado #1 (395 MW) had its
return date pushed back once again.  The Arizona-based unit was now sporting
an ETR of 06:30 MST on Saturday, but parties with a share in the unit said
they had not scheduled with it in place.  Meanwhile, Navajo #2 (750 MW) was
set to enter a planned maintenance outage on February 2, with an official
ETR of February 25.

With the return of winter weather and a rash of unit outages, peak power
prices strengthened across the Eastern Interconnect on Friday.  To the
relief of sellers, forecasts called for a dip in temperatures by Saturday.
""Get out and enjoy it, because tomorrow winter is back,"" recommended one
Philadelphia-based energy dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were
steady on Friday.  March was unmoved, closing at 2.138$/mmBtu, while April
rose less than a cent to end at 2.198$/mmBtu.

Heavy load electricity prices climbed back into the mid-20s in the
Mid-Atlantic on Friday, on expectations of stronger loads in the new week
and the possibility of a weekend outage.  Western PJM goods for Monday
delivery changed hands between 24.25 and 24.9$/MWh, gaining a robust 3$/MWh
at both ends of the spectrum.  LMPs appreciated on Friday after spending
most of the business day near 30$/MWh, but only averaged 24.47$/MWh.
According to sources, troubled coal-burner Keystone #2 (850 MW) was expected
off-line over the weekend for maintenance.  The unit was down earlier in the
week for unplanned repairs.  Temperatures in the comfortable 60s were
expected to disappear over the weekend.  Monday forecasts called for normal
conditions across PJM, with highs in the low-40s and lows in the low-30s.
The most current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from
February 7 to 11.

Expectations of early spring maintenance outages and colder weather
forecasts affected the grid on Friday, bolstering the dailies in ECAR.  Into
Cinergy deals were heard between 18 and 20.5$/MWh, firming up 65 cents to a
day ago.  In unit news, Missouri nuke Callaway (1,125 MW) was off-line on
Friday.  Quad Cities #2 (789 MW) was at 95%, powering down for a maintenance
outage expected to last through the end of February.  Sister unit #1 (821
MW) was still off-line early Friday, but expected to return over the
weekend.  Traders continued to keep their ear to the ground, hoping for
information on other upcoming maintenance outages.  Temperatures for the new
week were expected to drop back into the mid-30s across most of ECAR, with
overnight lows in the frosty low-20s.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS
called for above-normal temperatures from February 7 to 11.

With forecasts finally calling for cold temperatures and a stronger gas
market, peak power prices appreciated in the Southeast on Friday, while
Texas lost ground on little news.  Into Entergy day-ahead pieces were bought
and sold between 19 and 20.5$/MWh, while balance of February traded at a
slight discount around 18.9 to 19.1$/MWh.  ERCOT deals were mostly heard
between 19 and 19.75$/MWh on Friday.  SERC weather was expected to turn cold
with the new week, with overnight lows expected below freezing through
Tuesday.  Texas temperatures were expected to linger in the near-normal
doldrums.  The most current six-to-ten called for above-normal conditions in
Texas and northern SERC and normal temperatures in southern and coastal SERC
from February 7 to 11.

240,"Bill:

For yet another day we seem to be having problems including all the schedules in our EPE schedule sheet.  Tag 52159 was not included (25mw schedule to LADWP).  I think part of the problem is some counterparties are not including EPMIWE as a PSE.  Fortunately, the dispatchers had the schedule and informed me of the problem.  I then called LADWP and WESCO to checkout with them.  If this did not happen we wouldn't have known what the deal was.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Bert"
241,"Dear Green Roomers,

Registration for the spring season, which starts in April, is just around the corner, and we need to submit money to GPSD.  The cost of the ten-game is $50 per player.  Some of you have already paid $25 or so to Jon for the winter season, which unfortunately did not come to pass.  If I'm not mistaken, the following people have already paid: Jon Gail, Jon Bloomfield, Bill Williams, Jay Flint, Jake Fox, Rick Rezinas, Scott Gates, Scott H (the keeper) , Tristan Brunin, Frank Ma, and Declan.  These people need to pay and additional $25.  $50 for everyone else.

Please give me an email in the next week or two if you plan on playing, and send checks or money to the address below.

Additionally, you are encouraged to recruit solid skill players for the team.  Especially at the beginning of the season, more players is better, and fresh blood is always a way to build the team.

See you all soon,
Adam Van Loon

SW Left Out in the Cold

Peak power prices in the Western U.S. rose for the typically-discounted
Friday/Saturday package on continued strong weather-related demand and
new-month buying.  While temperatures in the Northwest have already begun to
ease, the Southwest was forecast to remain firmly entrenched in heating
demand country through Sunday.  Slightly stronger spot gas prices may also
have lent support to the dailies.  Balance-of-February contracts were still
trading below the dailies, but most players believed spot electricity prices
would fall to meet the balance next week as warmer weather prevails.  In
other industry news, the General Accounting Office (GAO) said Thursday that
it would sue the White House to try to force Vice President Cheney to
release documents detailing contacts between corporate executives and the
administration's energy task force of which Cheney was the chairman.  David
M. Walker, the comptroller general of the United States and director of the
accounting office, said he intended to ask a federal judge to order Mr.
Cheney to give Congress the identities of energy industry executives who
helped the Bush administration formulate a national energy policy last year,
detailing the subject that each executive discussed with task force members.

The average price paid for day-ahead heavy load energy in the Northwest rose
marginally Thursday on the last remnants of the region's most recent cold
snap, as well as increased demand from the south.  Temperatures had begun to
abate on Thursday, and the region's major load centers were forecast to
return to normal territory by Saturday.  The much-anticipated release of the
February Early Bird Water Supply Forecast from the Northwest River Forecast
Center showed that supplies in the region had risen from the previous report
issued on January 9, but remained mostly below normal on the Columbia and
Snake Rivers.  April through September supply forecasts at The Dalles rose
from 93 to 97 percent, while Grand Coulee gained one percent to 95 percent
for the same period.  ""The report may show that water supplies are still
below normal, but there's still plenty of time to beef up these numbers, and
we're already leaps and bounds ahead of where we were at this time last
year,"" said one Northwest trader.  In unit news, a quasi-official ETR for
Colstrip #3 (700 MW) emerged on Friday, calling for the unit to be back up
between February 5 and 7.  Since we are talking about a Colstrip unit here,
we have opted to err on the side of caution and go with the 7th.

Despite the expectation of gradually easing temperatures over the weekend,
day-ahead power prices firmed up for the Friday/Saturday package in the
Golden State.  ""Gas came up a little and new month jitters had everyone on
edge,"" joked one California trader about the day's action.  SP15 saw the
most strength, with heavy load deals heard between 24 and 27.45$/MWh.
Similarly, NP15 peak goods changed hands from 24 to 27$/MWh, with the bulk
of transactions in the 25 to 26$/MWh range.  Traders said BOM was, not
unexpectedly, still trading at a discount to the dailies.  In political
news, Governor Davis formally requested a FERC investigation into alleged
price manipulation by Enron last summer.  Specifically, the Governor accused
Enron of pushing prices up on long-term contracts.  The CPUC reached an
agreement with the DWR, which would allow the department to issue bonds to
repay the California general fund for power purchases it has made.  To date
the DWR has bought $10 billion worth of electricity, and expects that total
to reach $18 billion by the end of the year.   On the generation front,
Alamitos #4 (320 MW) joined off-line sister units #3 and #6 off-line on
Thursday.  Smaller units Huntington Beach #3 (225 MW) and Southbay #4 (222
MW) also exited the grid for unplanned and planned maintenance,
respectively.  Friday and Saturday forecasts called for highs to linger in
the low-50s mid-state and the low-60s in the south, with overnight lows
expected to be in the chilly 34 to 41 degree range.  Predictions for the new
week called for near-normal conditions, and the latest six-to-ten called for
normal temperatures from February 6 to 10.

As Phoenix residents continued to bask in overnight temperatures in the
mid-30s, peak power prices continued to rise for the Friday/Saturday combo.
Temperatures were forecast to start warming up beginning on Sunday,
prompting traders to expect falling loads and prices next week.  Peak power
at Palo Verde ranged from 23.5 to 26.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals going
through at the 25$/MWh mark.  Light load goods at the Southwest hub gained
as much as 2.5$/MWh with confirmed transactions anywhere between 16.75 and
19.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (395 MW) was still having trouble
returning from a January 25 tube leak outage, but sources familiar with the
Arizona-based unit were confident that it would begin to ramp up at 06:00
MST on Friday (though they weren't willing to put money on it).  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS continued to call for normal temperatures to blanket
the desert region from February 6 through 10.

___________________________________________________________
With the return of ice storms in the Midwest and generally winter-like
conditions to the entire East, peak power prices strengthened on Thursday.
""Prices would have risen even more today, but recent bearish trends have
prompted a wait-and-see attitude among traders,"" commented one Cinergy
dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures rose on Thursday.  March gained
5.8 cents to close at 2.138$/mmBtu, while April climbed 4.3 cents to end at
2.19$/mmBtu.

Expectations of colder weather in the Mid-Atlantic sent day-ahead
electricity prices higher on Thursday.  Western PJM goods changed hands
between 21.7 and 22$/MWh, while early deals for Monday delivery were heard
at 24.25$/MWh.  Traders said fewer Cinergy imports and more New York exports
were the real movers on Thursday.  Forecasts called for little change on
Friday, but substantial cooling over the weekend and into the new week.  The
most current six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal temperatures
for most of PJM and normal conditions along coast from February 6 to 10.

Amid cold weather and winter storms, heavy load energy costs jumped up in
the Midwest on Thursday.  Into Cinergy pieces for Friday were bought and
sold between 17.5 and 19.85$/MWh.  ""We only saw two trades below 19$/MWh
today, and most of our volume went through very close to the high end,""
commented one market player, an explanation echoed by most Cinergy traders
on Thursday.  Talk also centered on the new MidwestISO that will take over
transmission responsibilities on Friday.  Pointing to studies by the Edison
Institute and others, most traders thought any changes to the market would
happen gradually, and didn't expect any immediate affects on prices.  ""The
new rules will focus on generators for now,"" said one calm ECAR scheduler.
Next week deals also rose on Thursday, and were heard mostly between 20.15
and 20.35$/MWh.  ""The near term was modestly stronger today,"" summed up one
trader.  In unit news, Rockport (1,300 MW) was reportedly off-line for early
spring maintenance.  Also of note, ECAR load estimates were up from
approximately 31,000 for Friday to 34,000 for Monday.  Colder conditions
finally rolled into ECAR, with forecasts for Friday calling for temperatures
in the low-30s to mid-40s across most of the region.  The mercury was
expected to dip more in the new week, and the latest six-to-ten predicted
mostly above-normal temperatures from February 6 to 10.

Anticipation of a break in the bearish warm weather and rumors of units
coming off for early spring maintenance lent support to SERC and ERCOT spot
prices.  Into Entergy deals were heard between 17.6 and 20.25$/MWh, with
prices Into TVA and ERCOT also breaking into the 20s.  Strength in the
natural gas markets also cheered traders on Thursday.  Texas temperatures
took a dive on Thursday, with the cold front expected to spread into SERC
over the weekend.  The updated six-to-ten called for mostly normal
temperatures across SERC and Texas from February 6 to 10.

While there are a few people who are still making up their minds, the rest =
of the people in our office will be working for the Enron estate.  It is no=
t entirely clear to me right now what the management team for west power lo=
oks like for the Enron estate now.  As I understand it, there are two prima=
ry initiatives on the estate side that people in Portland may be a part of.=
The first is the disposition of our development projects that are already=
well under way.  Dave Parquet in San Francisco has been leading this effor=
t together with the Portland asset development team.  This effort has been =
ongoing since December.  The second is the disposition of our west power co=
mmodity positions.  Jim Fallon is in charge of this for the entire company.=
People working on this for Jim include Don Miller, Paul Racicot, Brad Ric=
hter, Ed Baughman among others.  I have placed a call to Jim and to Paul to=
get advice on how people in Portland should proceed.  I would recommend ta=
lking to Ed, Brad, Paul, or Don to get direction.  I have placed a call to =
several of these people to get direction and am waiting for a response.  I =
am hopeful that they will designate a lead person in Portland to coordinate=
the power procurement and delivery efforts.

As most of you know, the physical separation between UBS Warburg and Enron =
has already begun.  People who will continue to work for Enron will be loca=
ted on the 4th Floor, while UBS Warburg will occoupy the 3rd Floor.  We hop=
e to make the moves to the 4th Floor by the end of this week.  Moves within=
the 3rd Floor will take place the following week.

The UBS Warburg transaction is subject to one last pro forma regulatory hur=
dle.  While I don't have an exact date, I am told that it will likely be on=
or about February 6th.

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone for their help and cooperation=
over the last few weeks.  These have been really horrible times as the Enr=
on story continues to unfold in the news at the same time that people are f=
inding out about their future with Enron and UBS.  I know that this hasn't =
been easy for anyone.  I am deeply saddened overseeing the breakup of the a=
wesome team that we have put together.  Whether you are going to UBS, remai=
ning with Enron, or leaving the company, I wish everyone who worked on this=
team the best in their future endeavors.  It has been a distinct honor to =
work with each and every one of you.

Going Short for the Shortest Month

Day-ahead electricity prices in the Western U.S. were mostly higher
Wednesday on continued cold weather.  Some traders also said that rising
spot gas prices lent support to the daily power market.  ""The worst of this
cold snap appears to be over, but the market will likely take a day or so to
react,"" believed one marketer.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating
demand throughout the West was forecast to fall to below-normal levels over
the coming weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for
mostly normal temperatures from February 5 through 9.  February contracts
were trading a buck or two below the dailies at all of the major Western
hubs on Wednesday.  ""Historically, February has been a lighter load month
than January, and that's why we're heading into the new month with a short
position,"" said one matter-of-fact trader.  In other industry news,
Wednesday's AGA inventory report showed that U.S. gas stocks fell 111 bcf
last week, right in line with most industry estimates.  Total U.S.
inventories of 2.294 tcf were still 1.053 tcf, or 85 percent, above last
year.  Of the 111 bcf taken out of storage last week, 19 were drawn in the
Western Consuming region.  Total inventories in the West stood at 360 bcf,
or 71 percent of full.  Western stocks were at 222 bcf the same week a year
ago, and have averaged 265 bcf over the past five years.

Peak power prices in the Northwest rose marginally for Thursday delivery,
despite a general sense that the worst of the cold snap was over.  ""We were
a little surprised to see prices rise today because it is supposed to begin
warming up, and we are fairly bearish heading into February,"" said one
Washington-based trader.  Heating demand in the region was forecast to
steadily drop from 119 percent of normal on Thursday, to 99 percent of
normal on February 6.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward
again on Wednesday, coming in at 115 kcfs Thursday, 110 kcfs Friday, 80 kcfs
Saturday, 65 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs Monday and Tuesday, and 105 kcfs next
Wednesday.  In unit news, Bridger #4 (520 MW) was shut Wednesday morning due
to a plugged boiler.  While no ETR was given for the Wyoming-based unit,
sources familiar with thermal plants said such a problem is usually fixed in
48 hours or less.  While Colstrip #3 (700 MW) remained down with no official
ETR, some parties believed it would not return until February 9.

Amid continued below-normal forecasts for Thursday and stronger natural gas
values at the SoCal border, day-ahead electricity prices for delivery on the
last day of January gained ground in the Golden State.  Traders noted that
spot gas and light load prices were particularly strong.  ""I was surprised
that gas was strong today.  The forecasts are warming gradually though, so
gas should start to ease soon and electricity prices should fall off,"" said
one California trader.  Prices at COB settled higher on Wednesday, with
heavy load deals heard between 21.25 and 22.95$/MWh and light load changing
hands from 18 to 19.5.  ""We saw an opportunity to make some money at COB
today,"" said one Western dealer.  February COB lingered about 2$/MWh cheaper
than the dailies, with peak products heard trading near 20$/MWh and off-peak
pieces reportedly going through from 16.75 to 16.95$/MWh.  Similarly,
front-month deals at NP15 were heard about a dollar cheaper than the
dailies, near 22.75$/MWh for heavy load goods.  CAISO reported little change
in the overall generation landscape on Wednesday, with a difference of less
than 100 MW off-line to a day ago.  Of note, San Luis (326 MW) exited the
grid for planned maintenance.  Thursday temperatures were expected to reach
highs in the low-60s at southern load centers, and about 50 degrees at
mid-state.  The five-day forecast called for gradual warming, with
temperatures still expected to be about four degrees below normal on Sunday.
The most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from February 5 to
9.

While peak power prices in the Southwest dipped by 50 cents on both the high
and low ends, the bulk of deals were done at slightly higher levels than on
the previous day.  Continued cold weather and rising spot gas values were
the main factors lending support to the dailies on Wednesday.  Starting on
Friday, heating demand in the desert region was forecast to drop sharply,
dipping to below-normal levels by February 3.  Peak electricity prices at
Palo Verde ranged from 23$/MWh early, to a late-session high of 26$/MWh,
while February contracts were heard around the 21.65$/MWh mark.  Light load
goods for Thursday delivery traded from 14.75 to 17$/MWh, while February off
peak was seeing action near the 14.7$/MWh level.  There were no new outages
of consequence to report in the Southwest on Wednesday, but looking further
ahead, Palo Verde #2 (1,270 MW) was scheduled to shut for spring maintenance
from March 16 through April 20.  Weather forecasts called for gradual
warming over the coming weekend, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting normal temperatures from February 5 through 9.

___________________________________________________________
Amid expectations of continued warm weather through Friday and a natural gas
storage report within industry estimates, spot electricity prices were
mostly steady across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday.  Saturday
predictions called for below-normal temperatures, a break in the bearish
weather pattern that has been depressing demand and prices for much of
January.  The AGA weekly natural gas storage report listed a draw of 111
bcf.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were mixed, with March picking up
1.3 cents to close at 2.08$/mmBtu, while April slipped 0.3 cent to end the
day at 2.147$/mmBtu.

While revised loads and forecasts met with skepticism from traders in the
Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday, day-ahead electricity prices climbed slightly
higher.  ""Loads and temperatures were revised upwards today.  There's
supposed to be some colder weather for the weekend, but bullish forecasts
have been pushed back all month, so we'll see if the cold actually
materializes this time,"" commented one PJM player with a wait-and-see
attitude.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery changed hands between
21.2 and 22.2$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done around 21.6$/MWh.  LMPs
gradually increased from 09:00 through 11:30 EST reaching a high of 44$/MWh,
but averaged only 20.17$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  In unit news, sources said
Keystone #2 (850 MW) returned to the grid on Wednesday, back from a two-day
maintenance outage.  High temperatures were expected in the upper-40s to
low-50s on Thursday, with overnight lows in the 35 to 42-degree range.  The
latest six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 5 to 9.

Peak power prices settled lower in the Midwest on Thursday, as continued
bearish fundamentals took their toll on the ECAR market.  Into Cinergy
pieces were bought and sold between 16 and 18.5$/MWh, with the low end
reached in late trade.  No new outages were reported on Thursday, although
traders continued to speculate that many marginal units were off-line for
load following.  Temperatures were predicted to be slightly warmer on
Thursday.  However, the mercury was expected to drop about 15 degrees on
Friday.  The most current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures
from February 5 to 9.

With stronger than expected natural gas values, heavy load energy costs
edged higher in the Southeast on Thursday.  ""Prices were bouncing around
quite a bit today.  It was hard to figure out where things were,"" commented
one Entergy dealer.  Other sources said spring maintenance would start to
affect the market soon, as operators push repairs forward in light of low
prices and warm weather.  Into Entergy trades were heard between 16 and
17.5$/MWh, mostly in the 16s, while February changed hands from 18.35 to
18.5$/MWh.  Texas power remained steady, firming up a buck on the low end.
The bulk of Into TVA deals were done with a 17 handle, but early trades were
heard as low as 16$/MWh.  The updated six-to-ten called for mostly normal
conditions in SERC and Texas from February 5 to 9.

For 2002 Ercot is split into 4 zones with TCRs between 3 of the zones. The zones are fairly diverse from a supply/demand perspective. Ercot has an average load of 38,000 MW, a peak of 57,000 MW with a breakdown of 30% industrial, 30% commercial and 40% residential. There are already several successful aggregators that are looking to pass on their wholesale risk to a credit-worthy QSE (Qualified Scheduling Entity).

Our expectation is that we will be a fully qualified QSE by mid-March with the APX covering us up to that point. Our initial on-line products will include a bal day and next day financial product. (There is no day ahead settlement in this market). There are more than 10 industrial loads with greater than 150 MW concentrated at single meters offering good opportunities for real-time optimization. Our intent is to secure one of these within the next 2 months.

I have included some price history to show the hourly volatility and a business plan to show the scope of the opportunity. In addition, we have very solid analytics that use power flow simulations to map out expected outcomes in the real-time market.

The initial job opportunity will involve an analysis of the real-time market as it stands today with a view to trading around our information. This will also drive which specific assets we approach to manage. As we are loosely combining our Texas gas and Ercot power desks our information flow will be superior and I believe we will have all the tools needed for a successful real-time operation.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,

Doug"

New CEO to Resurrect Enron

Heavy load energy costs for Wednesday delivery turned in mixed results in
the Western U.S. on Tuesday, reflecting varying weather forecasts in
different regions.  ""The average price in the Northwest was slightly lower
today because temperatures were forecast to rise tomorrow, while the average
price in the Southwest rose slightly on expected cooler temperatures,"" said
one weather watcher.  Off-peak prices, however, were immune to geographical
boundaries, rising at just about all of the Western hubs on the cold
weather.  ""There were a lot of people looking to secure off-peak power today
in order to meet demand,"" said one trader of the stronger light load prices.
Nonetheless, some players were surprised by Tuesday's strength, noting that
the worst of the cold was likely over.  Accordingly, Weather Derivatives was
forecasting a general decline in heating demand throughout the West over the
course of the week, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting
mostly normal temperatures for the WSCC from February 4 through 8.  In
Enron-related news, ""Turnaround Expert"" Stephen Cooper was named interim CEO
of bankrupt Enron Corp. on Tuesday.  Cooper told Enron employees that their
company was in much better shape than some of the hundreds of other
companies he and his partners have represented in bankruptcies and
reorganizations.  ""They didn't start with nearly as strong a position as
this company.  They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy and I'm
confident that Enron will also,"" Cooper said in a company-wide voice mail on
Tuesday.  On Monday, about 400 former and current Enron employees filed suit
against several company officials and auditor Arthur Andersen in a federal
court in Houston, alleging that the defendants encouraged employees to buy
Enron stock without being notified about the company's precarious financial
condition.

Peak power prices in the Northwest fell by an average of nearly a buck on
Tuesday, likely due to forecasts indicating the worst of the region's most
recent cold snap had passed.  In addition, strong river flows made for
abundant hydroelectric generation.  Nonetheless, light load prices for
Wednesday delivery traded slightly higher than a day ago, on average.  ""It's
still cold at night, and a lot of the hydro is being pushed through during
the peak hours to meet demand, so we're just not seeing as many offers for
the light load hours,"" said one Northwest utility trader.  Flow forecasts
for Chief Joseph were ratcheted slightly upward on Tuesday, coming in at 110
kcfs through Thursday, 105 kcfs Friday, 80 kcfs Saturday, 65 kcfs Sunday,
110 kcfs Monday, and 105 kcfs next Tuesday.  According to Weather
Derivatives, heating demand in the region was forecast to be 124 percent of
normal on Wednesday, steadily falling to 99 percent of normal by February 3.
Meanwhile, the latest six-to-ten was calling for temperatures to be normal
in Oregon and Washington, and above normal in Idaho and Montana, from
February 4 through 8.

Amid below-normal temperature forecasts, flat spot gas values at the Socal
border, and firmer overnight heating demand, peak power prices were mostly
steady and off-peak prices strengthened in the Golden State on Tuesday.
Heavy load goods at NP15 changed hands predominantly between 23.5 and
24.25$/MWh, but one confirmed trade was heard at 26.5$/MWh.  Light load
pieces saw action from 18.25 to 19.75$/MWh.  Correction:  in the Energy
Market Report for January 28 we incorrectly reported that CPUC
administrative law judge Robert Barnett advised the commission to restore
the direct access provision, which was revoked September 20, 2001, allowing
industrial and household consumers to again chose their ESP through July 1,
2002.  In fact, Barnett's ruling would retroactively cancel direct access
from July 1, 2001 onward, nullifying contracts signed between July 1, 2001
and September 20, 2001.  ""This is not a restoration of choice.  This is a
post-birth abortion,"" emailed one reader.  Additionally, contracts penned
before July 1 but which didn't deliver power until after July 1 are also
cancelled under the new ruling.  ""To boil all this down to the simplest
terms, the DWR and the utilities are afraid that too much load switched to
alternate suppliers during that time frame (July through September).  Since
they bought too much power through high-priced contracts they have fewer
kilowatt hours to spread their costs against,"" summed up one market analyst
on the reason behind the new ruling.  The ruling is on the agenda for the
CPUC's February 7 meeting, at which point it could be enacted.  In unit
news, Calpine's Sutter Plants (546 MW) was almost back to full capacity on
Tuesday, generating at 525 MW.  Helms PGP #1 (407 MW) also returned to the
grid.  Wednesday forecasts called for temperatures to climb slightly, with
highs expected in the upper-40s to low-50s at mid-state load centers and
overnight lows anticipated near freezing.  The latest six-to-ten predicted
normal temperatures from February 4 to 8.


The average price for a 25-megawatt block of spot electricity rose
marginally in the Southwest Tuesday amid continued cold weather.  Heating
demand in the region was expected to remain well above normal through
Friday, but then drop to below-normal levels over the coming weekend.  ""It's
cold down here, especially at night, so we're having to buy to cover our
load,"" said one Phoenix-based trader shivering at the thought of overnight
lows in the 30s.  Peak power at Palo Verde saw action from 23.5 to
25.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed late-day trades heard as high as 26$/MWh.  There
was little in the way of unit news on Tuesday, except for word that
Arizona-based Coronado #1 (395 MW) was still having trouble making it back
online.  Weather forecasts called for gradual warming through the coming
weekend, while the latest six-to-ten was predicting a near-blanketing of
normal temperatures from February 4 through 8.

___________________________________________________________
With little change in market fundamentals to a day ago, peak power prices
posted mixed results across the Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday. Very warm
temperatures continued to smother demand across most of the East, while
cooler conditions were expected in ECAR and Texas, lending some support to
those regions.  According to traders, there were higher prices in the Summer
and Q4 term products on Tuesday.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures rose
on some short covering ahead of February's expiration.  The front month
crawled up 9.8 cents in its last gasp and closed at 2.006$/mmBtu, while
March gained 8.3 cents to end at 2.067$/mmBtu.

Weak demand pummeled the Mid-Atlantic again on Tuesday, sending day-ahead
electricity prices lower.  Western PJM goods for Wednesday delivery changed
hands between 21 and 21.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals heard around
21.25$/MWh.  February settled about a dime lower to a day ago, at 23.4$/MWh.
LMPs softened on Tuesday, averaging 18.11$/MWh through 15:00 EST, after some
mid-morning, short-lived volatility.  Rumors circulated of an outage at
Keystone #2 (850 MW) on Tuesday, but confirmation was not available, and
little effect was seen on the market regardless, sources said.  Forecasts
for Wednesday called for about five degrees of cooling, with highs expected
in the 57 to 65-degree range and overnight lows in the upper-40s.  The
mercury was expected to settle five degrees lower on Thursday.  The most
current six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from February 4 to 8.

Amid cooler forecasts for Wednesday, peak power prices strengthened in the
Midwest.  Into Cinergy pieces were bought and sold from 17 to 19.3$/MWh,
climbing almost a buck on the high end.  Temperatures were expected to drop
significantly on Wednesday, with highs forecast in the 39 to 49-degree range
across ECAR, with overnight lows about five degrees below there.  The latest
six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from February 4 to 8.

Peak power prices slipped in the Southeast on Tuesday, as warm weather kept
demand very soft.  ""It's gas close-out day so everyone's keeping an eye
turned to NYMEX.  A rally there could push spot gas higher tomorrow and thus
the dailies as well,"" said one SERC player.  Into Entergy deals were done
between 15 and 17.15$/MWh, settling to the low end late.  The February
contract weakened slightly on Tuesday, trading between 18 and 18.1$/MWh.
Texas power firmed up for Wednesday delivery, with much colder temperatures
expected across the Lone Star State.  The most current six-to-ten called for
mostly normal temperatures, with above-normal conditions in the north, from
February 4 to 8.

Enron-omic Stimulus?

Despite the continuing grip of a cold snap, and a rash of unit outages over
the weekend, most Western power prices for Tuesday delivery ended slightly
weaker in the first trading session of the new week.  ""Flows are up and
hydro's cheap,"" explained one marketer of the weather's inability to inject
strength into Western markets.  ""If the weather weren't as cold as it is,
the market could even be worse for sellers.""  As usual over the past few
months, references to Enron were peppered across the mainstream media on
Monday.  UBS Warburg, the Swiss bank that is in the process of purchasing
the now-defunct EnronOnLine, plans to have the trading business in full
operation by the end of February.  To staff the reborn operation, UBS
Warburg has offered contracts to about 625 of EnronOnLine's 800 former
employees.  The transaction is still pending the approval of various federal
agencies.  In another chapter of the Enron saga, Vice Chairman J. Clifford
Baxter's death was ruled a suicide by Harris County Medical Examiner Joye
Carter on Saturday.  Baxter was considered an important potential witness in
the Enron affair after whistle-blower Sherron Watkins cited his discussion
with then-CEO Jeff Skilling about the company's dubious accounting
practices.  A suicide note was found at the scene, but the details of the
note have not yet been released.  Equally serious are allegations made by
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, indicating that the White House had
apparently changed the contents of a draft energy proposal circulated
through Congress in March of last year to add a provision that specifically
aided Enron Corp. in India.  According to Rep. Waxman, ""the provision
appears to have been added to the plan during the period in which the White
House directly controlled the drafting.""  The Bush Administration has
understandably tried to distance itself from their biggest political
contributor, denying that its energy plan was crafted to help Enron.  In
related news, GAO head David M. Walker will likely sue Vice President Dick
Cheney for refusing to turn over documents relating to the VP's meetings
with Enron representatives last year.  It would mark the first time the
investigative arm of Congress sued another branch of the government for refu
sal to cooperate with an inquiry.  The Vice President insisted that the GAO
was overstepping its bounds. ""Their jurisdiction extends to agencies created
by statute. That's not me,"" asserted Cheney, ""I'm a constitutional officer.
And the authority of the GAO does not extend in that case to my office.""
Save it for the judge, Dick.  In gas news, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas
futures fell hard in Monday trading, with the February contract losing 12.9
cents to settle at 1.908$/mmBtu, and the March contract close behind,
plummeting 12 cents to close at 1.984$/mmBtu.

Heavy load energy prices in the Northwest fell almost 2$/MWh on the low end
for Tuesday delivery.  Healthy hydro flows and a cold front that did not
quite live up to its prediction took the brunt of the blame.  Peak goods at
Mid-Columbia changed hands from 18.8 to 22$/MWh on Monday.  Flows at Chief
Joseph remained as strong as ever this year, coming in at 110 kcfs Tuesday,
105 kcfs Wednesday and Thursday, 100 kcfs Friday, 85 kcfs Saturday, 65 kcfs
Sunday, and 110 kcfs next Monday.  Temperatures were predicted to remain
well below normal through Friday, with lows expected to flirt with freezing.
The latest six-to-ten likewise called for temperatures to remain near to
below normal from February 3 to 7.  There were no new unit outages to report
on Monday.

Despite cold weather and a modest rise in natural gas values at the Socal
border, day-ahead electricity prices softened in the Golden State on Monday.
Heavy load goods lost about 2$/MWh everywhere, while light load prices took
a bigger hit, slipping almost 4$/MWH.  Peak power at SP15 traded between 23
and 25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done closer to the high end, above
24.25$/MWh. In California politicking, the CPUC voted to reject a compromise
put forth by SDG&E parent Sempra Energy.  The proposal would have used $219
million of the $363 million earned selling power from five-year contracts at
wholesale prices last summer to pay down the balancing account, and thus
benefiting SDG&E rate payers, while allocating the remaining $144 million to
shareholders.  The CPUC said they think the courts will award a higher
number to the balancing account. Californians may soon be allowed to choose
their power provider again, if CPUC administrative law judge Robert Barnett
has his way.  The initiative, a cornerstone of the 1996 deregulation bill,
was revoked September 20, 2001.  However, consumers would have to hurry
their selection, as the option would be back in play for a limited time,
through July 1, 2002.  Barnett said competitive choice was essential to keep
utility customers from unfairly footing the bill for last year's energy
crisis.  On the generation front, Morro Bay #4 (336 MW) and Pittsburg #7
(682 MW) returned to service over the weekend.  Helms PGP #1 (407 MW) joined
sister unit #2 (407 MW) in the out of service category on Monday.  Alamitos
#3 (320 MW) exited the grid on January 26.  Hydro Big Creek (1,020 MW) was
derated, operating at 720 MW.  Sutter Plants (546 MW) was generating at 270
MW.  Tuesday forecasts called for temperatures to linger almost 10 degrees
below normal, with highs in the upper-40s to mid-50s across the state.  The
latest six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.

The Southwest was a slight exception to the conditions prevalent across the
WSCC on Monday.  While temperatures were lower than on Friday, peak power
prices remained mostly flat.  Heavy load pieces at Palo Verde traded between
22.75 and 25.75$/MWh, a loss of 75 cents on the low end and no change on the
high.  Temperatures were expected to linger well below normal through
Friday, and the latest six-to-ten predicted likewise from February 3 to 7.
In unit news, coal-fired Navajo #3 (750 MW) returned to the grid Monday
morning, while the ETR for Coronado #1 (395 MW) was revised to early morning
Tuesday, January 29.  Fellow coal unit Huntington #2 (455 MW) also climbed
back onto the grid over the weekend after repairing a tube leak.

As unseasonably warm weather continued and traders harbored little hope of
an upside in the gas market, peak power prices remained mostly steady on
Monday across the Eastern Interconnect.  Traders reported light trading
volume and lots of sunshine outside their windows.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural
gas futures reached new contract lows on Monday, a familiar refrain heard
during the past week.  February lost 12.9 cents in its second to last
trading session, ending the day at 1.908$/mmBtu.  March plunged a similar 12
cents to close at 1.984$/mmBtu.

With a healthy generation landscape and temperatures more usual to late
spring blanketing the region, day-ahead peak electricity prices settled
lower in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.  Western PJM goods for Tuesday delivery
changed hands between 20.95 and 22.1$/MWh, with most deals done in the 21.05
to 21.5$/MWh range.  Balance of the week trades were heard around 21.7$/MWh,
while balance of the month deals went through near 23.4$/MWh.  Despite an
unusual brief spike to 73$/MWh just after 13:00 EST, LMPs were averaging
21.26$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Traders reported lackluster trading and no
new outages on Monday.  Tuesday forecasts called for high temperatures to
linger in the balmy 63 to 68 degree range across PJM, before cooling about 5
degrees on Wednesday.  The most current six-to-ten predicted normal
temperatures from February 3 to 7.

Despite record highs near 60 degrees and more of the same expected for
Tuesday, heavy load energy costs were flat to slightly higher in the Midwest
on Monday.  Into Cinergy deals for Tuesday delivery were heard between 17
and 18.5$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions from 17.75 to 18$/MWh.  Most
traders were surprised by the relative strength of the Cinergy hub.  ""I
suspect there are quite a few coal units turned off, and most maintenance
schedules have been pushed forward, since the generation clearly isn't
needed,"" commented one ECAR trader.  In unit news, Quad Cities #1 (821 MW)
remained down for pump support maintenance.  Sources said they expected
sister unit #2 (821 MW) to be taken off-line for the same repairs when #1
returned to the grid, possibly as soon as this week.  The south shore of
Lake Erie, a region where January snow is usually measured in feet, enjoyed
high temperatures in the low-60s on Monday and anticipated the same on
Tuesday.  Indeed, all of ECAR expected similar conditions for Tuesday, while
cooling into the upper-40s was forecast for Wednesday.  The latest
six-to-ten called for normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.

As weak weather-related demand dominated SERC and Texas, peak power prices
weakened on Monday.  Into Entergy deals were done between 15.5 and 18$/MWh,
with the low end reached late in the day.  ""I don't see any possibility of a
rally for February.  Gas was hammered again today; the market is very soft
right now,"" commented one SERC realist.  Tuesday was expected to see high
temperatures solidly in the 70s across SERC and Texas, with slight cooling
predicted as the week progresses.  The most current six-to-ten called for
normal temperatures from February 3 to 7.

275,"With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

276,"Notice to Market Participants

The latest revision to the Market Design 2002 (MD02) proposal is now posted
on the ISO Home Page at http://www.caiso.com Current Issues, then  Market
Design 2002.  Or try this link:
http://www.caiso.com/docs/09003a6080/13/d1/09003a608013d13f.pdf .

Based on feedback at the focus group meetings and the ISO review of written
comments on the January 8 preliminary draft, the ISO has modified the
proposed MD02 timeline significantly.

The ISO held four separate focus groups in Folsom on January 14-17, 2002 to
discuss the proposal and to solicit feedback on the proposed MD02 package.
Over 100 individuals participated in the meetings, either in person or by
phone.  They represented scheduling coordinators, investor owned utilities,
load serving entities, municipals, other control areas, and consumer
representatives.  In addition, many interested parties submitted comments
last week.  Two consistent messages the ISO received suggested that (1) the
timeline was too aggressive and (2) the Available Capacity (ACAP) proposal
needed additional work and explanation.

In response to these concerns, the ISO has modified the timeline:

*	The Board will receive a status report at its regularly scheduled
meeting on February 7, 2002, but will not vote on the comprehensive design
package until its March 14 meeting.  The ISO plans two separate filings at
FERC, one in late March and one on May 1, 2002.

*	The ACAP proposal will likely not be included in the Phase 1 FERC
filing in late March.

Please see the revised MDO2 draft proposal now posted on the ISO website for
more specifics regarding the schedule for advancing the proposal to the ISO
Board of Governors and the FERC.  The ISO requests that any additional
comments from the public be submitted by Thursday, January 31, 9 a.m. (PST),
so they can be included in the Board discussion.  (Note the Thursday
deadline is an extension of the original Wednesday deadline discussed in
earlier messages)  Please submit to Byron Woertz at bwoertz@caiso.com.

Again, the ISO would like to thank those who attended the MD02 focus groups
and/or submitted written comments.   The ISO will keep you posted on further
opportunities for review and feedback on details of the MD02 design.

Could Enron's Business Model Actually Work?

January 28, 2002

By DANIEL ALTMAN




Is Enron (news/quote)'s business model still a good one?
With fuzzy financing and arcane accounting stripped away,
the answer may be yes. Despite Enron's collapse, its goal
of merging the best thinking in energy, finance and
information technology as an online commodity trader still
garners respect.

""Enron failed because they were scamming, but the basic
virtual market part was fine,"" said Dale Kutnick, chief
executive and research director of the META Group
(news/quote), an information technology consultancy. ""There
is still a real market for virtual trading companies, no
question about it.""

Enron traded contracts for electricity and natural gas and,
later, other products like rights to high-speed
telecommunications networks and financial hedges against
changes in the weather. It used a sophisticated online
platform backed by a financial apparatus meant to hedge the
company's bets. In the words of Kurt Launer, an analyst who
follows Enron for Credit Suisse First Boston, the company
had ""the pioneering online venture for real-time
availability of information"" used in trading commodities.

*
Enron's basic business model, in other words, may yet
serve as a model for other companies. In the wake of
Enron's bankruptcy filing, some of the best support for
that model model came from its competitors.

Reliant Energy (news/quote) is one of several companies
that followed Enron in offering online exchanges for
electricity and natural gas.

""Our commodity markets worked just fine the day after Enron
went away,"" said Joe Bob Perkins, president and chief
operating officer of the wholesale group at Reliant.

""Everybody got gas, everybody got power, and prices stayed
basically the same,"" Mr. Perkins said. ""The loss of one
intermediary just proves that these competitive markets
work.""

Other companies offering similar services rushed to fill
the gap after Enron suspended its trading. ""We've picked up
market share,"" said Stephen L. Baum, the chairman,
president and chief executive of Sempra. He noted, though,
that unlike Enron, ""our trading, although extremely
important and a big income earner for us, is not the
centerpiece of our business.""

Another company that sees continued value in the Enron
approach is UBS Warburg, the Swiss investment bank, which
bought Enron's electricity and gas trading business in
bankruptcy proceedings and plans to restart them under its
own brand.

""We're confident we can re-establish the business,"" David
Walker, a UBS Warburg spokesman, said. ""It is a first-rate
trading platform.""

Similarities between UBS Warburg's financial derivatives
business and Enron's trading of energy contracts were one
factor that made the deal appealing, Mr. Walker said. ""The
characteristics of trading these types of products and
betting on interest rates, which is a core ability of UBS,
are similar,"" he said. ""They're kind of neighbors.""

Mr. Kutnick, the research chief, added that Enron had
""outstanding"" information technology organization that was
backed by ""tremendous amounts of money."" In that way as
well, he said, the company ""was certainly comparable to the
best financial companies out there.""

Because of Enron's technological advantage, Mr. Kutnick
predicted, UBS would have little difficulty regaining
Enron's market share. ""They were far enough ahead that it
shouldn't be an issue,"" he said. ""If you are a couple
seconds faster in terms of spotting and executing a market
inefficiency, obviously you're going to make money.""

According to experts who consulted for Enron in the field
of finance, the company did not necessarily come up with a
lot of powerful new ideas. Its strength was in synthesizing
existing ideas, which sometimes led to innovative methods.

""They took a lot of finance theory and applied it in the
context of their business,"" said Ramesh K. S. Rao, a
professor of finance at the University of Texas who once
consulted for Enron. ""There was no magic to what they were
doing.""

Robert L. McDonald, a professor of finance at Northwestern,
advised Enron on the use of derivatives from 1993 to 1995.
He said the company needed advanced financial tools to
price its derivatives, which specified energy products to
be delivered at various times and sites while demand was
uncertain. ""That's a hard problem, so they were probably
breaking some new ground trying to deal with that,"" he
said. ""It's the kind of thing that's easy to describe and
may be hard to do.""

Peter Tufano, a professor at the Harvard Business School
who studied Enron, said the company had been using what
would be considered ""best practices"" for using derivatives
by any ""serious financial firm"" in the early 1990's.

Had Enron stuck to those practices, Mr. Kutnick said, it
might still survive today.

""Enron could have done extremely well with betting on
market inefficiencies and hedging bets,"" he said. ""People
stop hedging because they get too enamored of their own
theories."" As a parallel, he cited Long- Term Capital
Management, the hedge fund, which failed in 1998 when it
could no longer cover the ever-higher risks it began
taking.

Enron also betrayed its success, Mr. Launer said, by
throwing money at ventures that failed to generate cash
flow. For example, Enron spent around $2 billion on its
network capacity, or bandwidth, exchange, which never
turned a profit. ""The fact that Enron became a dot-com,
financed itself like a dot-com, and then suffered a demise
like a dot-com,"" he said, ""is one of the central parts of
this story.""

But Enron's failed attempts to expand its online trading
system to products beyond electricity and natural gas might
not rule out future, similar endeavors.

""In any commodity, there are always people who have too
much and others who have too little, so there's always
going to be a need for them to trade and exchange,""
Professor Tufano said.

Mr. Launer suggested that Enron's efforts were simply
ill-timed. ""These things take a while to get going,"" he
said. He noted that the deregulation of electricity and
natural gas led to a long period during which the market
for energy products and their derivatives evolved. ""It does
take a while before users of a commodity get comfortable
with the idea that they should risk-manage and out-source
their use of that commodity.""

293,"All:

A more detailed version  of CAISO's MD02 proposal was released on Wednesday.  Below I am copying a summary prepared by Andy Brown who covers these matters for IEP.

It appears that the CAISO proposal will allow for SC's to go short or long in the R/T market (i.e., final schedules do not need to be balanced).  That's good.

I think the most material issue at this point is how the forward capacity requirement (ACAP, akin to ICAP) will affect our trading.

GAC

What is CAISO proposing?

First off, there are ""target price"" and ""intra-zonal congestion management""
FERC filings that are apparently almost ready for a drop at FERC.  The
""comprehensive"" package would build off that.

In essencence, CAISO is proposing a capacity market (similar to what IEP
proposed at the CPUC ""Procurement OIR"") that has an ""available capacity
obligation"" (ACAP) on the load-serving entities (LSEs, aka the utilities and
electric service providers).  This is the solution to the ""all spot, all the
time"" design that was associated with the CPUC's ""mandatory buy/sell""
requirement and failure to provide forward reasonableness guidelines for the
utilities.  The LSEs would be required to show / specify to CAISO the ACAP
resources on a month-ahead basis equal to at least 115% of the coming
month's peak demand.  ACAP resources can be the LSE's own generation,
generation under contract, etc.  Failure to procure sufficient ACAP would
lead to penalties.  Also, CAISO appears to suggest that it would be in the
middle of arrangements between a LSE and the capacity supply as it would
penalize the supplier for failure to be available, operate as dispatched,
etc.  That wrinkle seems like it calls for 3 party contracts or some element
of complexity that shouldn't necessarily be required.  Its not clear from
the paper how costs for CAISO-dispatched ACAP resource would be allocated to
other SCs, particularly where a LSE contracted for the capacity, but CAISO's
running it to cover someone else's short energy schedule?

It is not particularly clear how DWR resources fit into the mix (there seems
to be a contradictory statement in the paper).  However, CAISO is proposing
a two-year ""transition"" mechanism where CAISO would provide the ACAP
resources (based on their stellar creditworthiness?? or DWR resources??).
There could be tension here with the proposals at the CPUC proceeding.
Also, it appears that an argument can be made that DWR is a LSE under the
terms of AB 1x.

CAISO is also moving toward a forward nodal-based congestion mechanism,
similar to the PJM type of design.  It is based on a 3000 bus network model
with simplified modeling of adjacent control areas.  Dispatch will be on an
optimized basis that on resource constraints (that appears to be dynamic)
including transmission capacity changes (increased ATC when ETC rights are
freed up, etc.) and generation availability.  There will be some degree of
node aggregation (in the form of demand locations and trading hubs).  It
appears that RMR contracts could disappear under this approach, although
that is not completely clear.

Creation of the forward congestion approach with security based optimization
effectively removes the need for the ""balanced schedule"" requirement.  Under
the proposal, CAISO would make trades happen in realtime through the
optimization to the extent not addressed through the forward markets. CAISO
calls for the resurrection of a day ahead energy market (FERC has called for
that).  CAISO says its open to that market being run outside of CAISO, but
that the need is for a centralized day ahead energy market that could help
shape resource needs.

CAISO would have the ability to dispatch identified ACAP resources not
already scheduled by the LSE.  They speak in terms of a ""residual unit
commitment"" requirement ... something akin to the ""long lead time"" proposal
under the ""must-offer"" requirement.  Their start and min load payment
proposal would be continued, subject to loosing it for unavailability or
participation in the market.

Note that CAISO states they will need to mitigate bids due to ""locational
market power"", particularly in relation to congestion.  I thought that
locational market power was addressed via RMR.  This raises the ""black box""
issue if CAISO is going to say on a realtime basis that they have some
dynamic problem and only a particular generation asset could address the
problem so we're mitigating your bid curve based on some form of proxy
pricing mechanism.  To some extent, in a nodal system, CAISO could argue
that more folks have ""locational market power.""  We'll need to review other
markets' treatment of this issue.

The future of the AS markets is questioned in the paper, and there's the
specific suggestion that the replacement reserve market is unnecessary if
ACAP is put into place.  This is probably the largest hole in the paper,
because there's a clear implication that something should happen and
presumably CAISO has at least come up with some set of options on the issue
(i.e., kill AS, have AS markets but alter products, have one AS product but
expect low volume, etc).

One element that seemed missing was a discussion of demand response.  In
many respects that element has been consistently missing in the market, save
the extraordinary conservation last summer.  There is a suggestion that the
ACAP requirement could be addressed by demand response, but presumably that
would need to be demand that could be dispatched by CAISO, and those
resources are particularly limited under the current CAISO demand-side
design.  While efforts on interruptible programs has occurred at the CPUC,
it is not clear that the two entities are heading in the same direction.

It was noted earlier that the ACAP proposal is similar to what IEP (and
others) suggested at the CPUC Procurement OIR.  Based on a lone comment by a
CPUCer during the CAISO media call yesterday, the CPUC is very far behind
the curve on these issues, and there is absolutely no coordination on this
issue.  Given that the same ""solution"" is popping up in both venues, there
is a real need to make sure that the two pieces can fit together, while
avoiding a bureaucratic paralysis that could happen if a formal attempt to
""coordinate"" the venues is proposed.

The bad news is that we did not get a team in the 5 game winter turf season.
Since we have had a team the past two years and they had more teams than

Not sure who is in charge of the indoor team but I noticed we have our first
game of the upcoming season this Thursday night at 10:15 against FC Cosmos.
For more info go to

As for me my hamstring is slowly healing so I should be back out there

been trying to get in touch with yall for quite
some time.

Please reply back to this message and let me
know how ""Things"" are.  Yes, the question is
ambiguous, but try to go with it.

In response to ""What up?:""

Everything has reached a new status quo. I live
in Gig Harbor and attend class at UW Tacoma
(UWT for short).  Class is great and their are
plenty of beautiful lasses for viewing
pleasure.  Hopefully I will be out of GH soon.
I will start looking for jobs in Portland,
Seattle, and SF (possibly) in Spring.  I have
not been working on my tan.

I would really like to visit the city of Roses
in the next few weekends.  What are your
plans?   I hope everything is well with you.
Please write back soon.

Buenos Nachos,

314,"To the West Desk et al:

The FERC's west-wide price cap has been raised to at least $108/MWh beginning today through 30 April 02.  Please see the order excerpt below.  Although market prices are well below both the old and new cap, the new cap will give the markets more breathing room if there is an unexpected cold snap and/or supply disruption.

I am happy to report that the one of Enron's advocacy messages made it into the order: any change to the cap must be applied West-wide.  PNW parties and Duke were willing to settle with region-specific caps but FERC rejected that concept in favor of a single, West-wide value.

Alan Comnes

Relevant Passage:

""Effective on the trading day following the date of this order, through April 30, 2002, we will suspend the methodology used to calculate the current mitigated price and substitute the following West-wide winter season methodology. As a starting point, the
mitigated price will be set at $108/MWh. This is the actual mitigated price set using the current methodology during the last reserve deficiency on May 31, 2001, based on a gas index of $6.641/MMBtu, a generating unit with a heat rate of approximately 15,360 Btu/MWh and $6.00 for the O&M adder. The new interim mitigated price will supersede the existing mitigated price (approximately $92/MWh), which was set at eighty-five percent of the originally calculated $108/MWh mitigated price for application during non-reserve deficiency hours. We find this adjustment necessary to set the price for the winter period and to track changes in the gas indices.

The winter formula will maintain the current heat rate and O&M adder. The one variable in the formula will be tied to the current average of the mid-point for the monthly bid-week index prices reported for SoCal Gas (large packages), Malin and PG&E city-gate. Under the winter season formula, the mitigated price will be recalculated when the average gas price rises by a minimum factor of 10 percent (e.g., to $7.305/MMBtu) effective for the following trading day. The formula will also track subsequent
cumulative changes of at least 10 percent (including reductions of 10 percent, but not less than a floor of $108/Mwh). Effective on May 1, 2002, the summer methodology will be reinstated along with the current mitigated price of approximately $92/Mwh for non-emergency periods."""

330,"Bob,
Sorry for the late response, I've been gone the last 10 days. I will not be
able to make the meeting on June 27. I do like Jack Dempsey's proposal. I'm
not sure I completely understand Mons' reasoning, but I believe the PSE
submission deadline should be left at 30 minutes for the following 2
reasons:

1. 3A1 is very explicit in its definition of transaction start time and
excluding the ramp time. If we change it to read ""20 minutes prior
to start"" that would allow a tag to be submitted at 40 after.

2. If the 20 minutes verbage is to be used, then the the remaining verbage
defining transaction start time as excluding ramp time will
need to be removed.

It was my understanding that both proposals intended to leave the real-time
deadline at :30 after.

However, I still have the same questions as a few weeks ago with respect to
the new BP's being put forth by the ESC/ESTF. Are we going to take into
account the BP's that the ECS/ESTF have put out/being commented on? The
schedule process BP has several ramping/timing changes, as well as frag
tags. They aren't asking whether or not we should adopt Eastern Connection
timelines, they're just doing it.

Personally, I don't think the majority of the WSCC's units can handle a 10
minute ramp, and the idea of finishing the ramp on the quarter is a prelude
to a perpetual time error correction and excessive inadvertent accounts.
However, that is being proposed.

I would appreciate someone else's opinion on where the proposed BP's fit in
with our goal.

supportive of the change to remove the preschedule flag and also to use the
LCA prevailing time.  Thanks for the opportunity to comment.
"
341,"Jerry Dempsey has sent the attached regarding the preschedule flag in E-Tag.

What he is proposing is:
*	a revision to the timeline tables in A3A to enable software to make
the determination of whether or not a tag is for preschedule or real-time
(currently it is a flag set by the PSE creating the tag).
*	Referencing time in terms of the Load Control Area's prevailing time
(this fits the Authority Service is associated with the load control area
and it's the Authority Service that keeps the time).

It may be possible to get this revision worked in to the 1.7 release.

Process
Please review his proposal and comment.
Specifically, do you support the concept of removing the flag and using the
timing table logic?
Do you support adjusting times to reference the Load Control Area prevailing
time?

If we reach a consensus on this issue by the end of the week, we can forward
on a recommendation to Mark for distribution to the whole ISAS.  If there is
support from all of ISAS, then it can be taken to NERC IS/TISWG for
approval.

343,"Has anyone, or everyone, read the latest business practice proposal
that was released by NERC on Tuesday? It is ESC's Scheduling and Approval
Practices submitted by the Multiple Task Groups - Scheduling Process,
Approval, Schedule Timing, Granularity and Ramping Task Groups.
Specifically, they are recommending changing the ramp time to a
10-minute straddle ramp (:55 to :05). In addition, they're recommending
allowing schedule changes on the quarter (as already exists at :15, :30,
:45) with a 10 minute ramp. Their reasoning is, and this is a quote, ""large
generators that require longer Ramp times (e.g. 20 or 30 minutes), could
partially ramp for 10 minutes across the schedule start, then finish with
another 10-minute ramp across the next quarter to complete the full ramp.
This would accommodate areas such as Florida and WSCC, where longer ramp
times are needed.""
Their asking for feedback for the public posting. This proposal has
a serious impact on our recommendations. Anyone have any comments? I'm

346,"Right.  Well, work is always crazy for you I suppose.  Yeah, I'm getting
ready to move.  This is my last week of work at the restaurant (thank god!)
and I have three weeks of class left.  I'll leave on the last day of class
(June 14) bright and early in the morning and drive west until I hit CO.
Still don't have a place to live, but I'm working on that.

I'll probably be coming back to Portland for a weekend or so during the
summer sometime so I'll look you up when I get there, if you want.

Good luck with work, I know you're doing a great job.

347,"Hey Bill (or do you prefer William Williams the 3rd),

What's up?  I bet you didn't think I'd e-mail you.
Don't worry, I have nothing against players.  Just
kidding...

I hope you had a good time at the show last weekend.
Maktub were pretty cool.  I know they play around
Seattle frequently so I'll check them out again
sometime.  Maybe you'll luck out and they'll come to
Portland soon.  I'm sure you have a decent music scene
in Portland so you always have other options.  I've
found that you can find some really cool little bands
or musicians in the most random little bars and
restaurants.

I hope all is well in Portland at the moment.  Seattle
has been pretty sunny and warm so I can't complain.
I'm totally looking forward to summer.  There will be
something to do every weekend.  Thank god.  Time to
start taking all my ""sick"" days!

Have a good day.  Don't work too hard.   If you do,
make sure you play harder to make up for it.

Talk to you later.
Colleen (the first)

354,"Bill,

How's your day going? You seem busy and/or pre-occupied. Do you still wanna go get some coffee? If you are too busy, don't worry about it. I just need to drink some coffee whether it is here or there...

355,"Hey. I saw this sunrise from my place this morning. Granted it didn't look as cool as it probably did from up here, but it was pretty sweet. It was so orange and pinkish. I wasn't here too late last night which ruled. Yeah, I went to Bally's and did the cross country machine and the stairmaster. Funny. I look like such a retard on those machines, but anyways. I guess that place it ok, but I just feel really self-conscious when I am there. At the Enron gym in Houston I just felt more at ease or something. I wanted to go into the free weight area to do some lunges and tricep work last night, but the meatheads scared me off. It was pretty lame I admit, but what can I say? Anyhoo, coffee sounds good to me as it usually does. Let me know when is good for you (maybe 9ish)."

You'll be having a blast in Vegas though, so no biggie. Anyhow, I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Maybe we can go get a beer after work tomorrow night if you don't leave too early. If not, there will be much beer to drink when you get back into town next week.

357,"Howdy.

So are you about to leave work or what? I really can't believe that it is already 4:30. Crazy. Anyhows, are you going to that Happy Hour deal on thursday night? Free drinks?! Should be a good time. I didn't make it to the last one and I was kinda bummed about it.

I hope I can get outta here at a reasonable hour tonight. I'm gonna go pump some iron at Bally's with all the meatheads if I do. Should be pretty fun. See ya later!"

Is this the David Gray you are going to see?? I listened to these clips. The music is kind of slow and romantic or something. Is this how most of his sound is or did I just pick slower songs to listen to?"
359,"Good morning. I'm glad to hear that you are having a better day today. Me, too so far. Yeah, I stayed last night until like 7:45 and finished up that stuff with Mike Etringer. So today should be a bit more chill for me which is awesome. Anyhow, I hope nothing blows up over there for you. Maybe we can go to get some coffee later or something. Did you end up going out last night for some beers? I watched Alli McBeal and ate dinner. It was pretty exciting."
360,"Bill,
I am having such a terrible day. I am so flustrated. Can you believe it is only monday? Ah! Anyhow, I hope your day is going much better than mine. When I saw you earlier, you looked kinda angry or something. I hope I was just imaging that. Anyhow, I'd better get back to work. I'll talk to you later."
361,"Good morning,

I'd love to go get some coffee with you, but remember that annoying project that Mike Etringer wants me to work on for him? This morning I am kinda under some pressure to hurry up and try to get some stuff figured out so I really don't have much spare time right now. JA would flip out if I left for coffee now. Maybe later this afternoon? Or tomorrow morning? Anyhow, another ride sounds really cool. I had lots of fun. And yes, it would be cooler if I didn't have to worry about work. Let me know when you have extra time to go for a ride.
My weekend was pretty fun. I weed-wacked (is that a word?) my yard for the first time. It looks so bad. I so don't know anything about lawn care. Also I planted some herbs and stuff in my yard which I am sure my dog will destroy, but it s worth a try. Oh yeah, I also bought a snowboard. It's pretty cool. I bought some step-in switch boots, too. Cool, eh?
So I'll talk to you later. Have a great day."

364,"This sheet is as complete as possible, and I am worried about it due to the following circumstances;

1.  The Dispatch sheet that comes to Real time was 25 MW flat on Sunday and LLH on Monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged today.

2.  The Four Corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between 5:15 and 5:42, from 10 mw long to flat. I tried to resolve the four corners schedules with PSCO, who
told me they did not have a purchase from EPE in July.  I tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to Enron each time. Lisa had a buy resale with PNM at four corners, but that booked out and did not seem to match the 10 long that I saw in the dispatch sheet.  I spoke with Pete, who assured me that the sale to PSCO was good for the summer.

3.  I still was unable to resolve the 25 mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew, and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule.  No EPE representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules, and I was referred by a Dispatch person to call on Saturday and speak to Carlos when he came in at 4 pm.  I was very uncomfortable doing this, and so in my desperation called Roger at home, who after some discussion with Steve at his home confirmed that the extrat 25 flat Sunday and LLH Monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on July 3.  I trust his assesment, and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet.



Between all of the preschedulers today at Enron, we have spent over 6 hours dealing with the EPE schedules today.

The sheet is as complete as I possibly can find justification for.

382,"Hey Guys.

We have a new way to export from NP15 up to the Northwest. Cascade is a tie between CISO and PAC SYSTEM on the California Oregon border. There is currently 30MW Non-Firm Hourly transmission available on the tie.

The capacity constraint is on the PacifiCorp side of the tie,  and you can find the real number available on the PAC oasis site. Check under TRANSMISSION REQUESTS/ Offerings. The path name you need to check is W/PPW/CRAG-PACW//. Make sure you pick Hourly non-firm.

On the CISO side the tie point is called CASCAD_1_CRAGVW by the CISO.


Procedure:
Export at Cascade from the CISO.
Buy PAC Transmission from CRAG to BPAT or whoever is picking it up from Pac System.

Transmission costthrough PAC is only $5.84.

I know the NP15/MIDC spread is not as large as we have seen it in the past. It does on the other hand give us another option.

388,"Hey Guys.

We have a new strategy taking power from the south to the north. Right now Sierra Pacific will only let us schedule 12MW on the tie so do not try to schedule any more (The tie is only good for 17MW).

- Either do a export from SP15 to Silverpeak or put in a wheel going out at Silverpeak(From PV or FC).
- Buy transmission from SPP from  (www.swoasis.com ) CONTROL TO HILLTOP. ($6.90 on-peak, $3.90 off-peak)
- Buy transmission from PAC from MAL2 TO MAL5. ($5.84)
- Buy transmission from BPA from HILLTOP TO SNOHO or another Sink. (Account numbers below).

We need to bounce this of SNOHO before we send it back in at Malin.

THIS SCHEDULE NEEDS TO BE TAGGED OR SIERRA PACIFIC GETS VERY PISSED OFF, THEY ARE NOT USED TO DOING TO MUCH REAL TIME. THERE IS A TEMPLATE FOR THIS SCHEDULE SO IT SHOULD NOT BE HARD. Call and confirm the request with both PAC and Sierra.



Also do not sell to a marketer(especially POWEREX) without sleeving. We do not want anybody else to know about the path. If Powerex sees this I guarantee that they would try to schedule this and we do not want competition. Right now the only person using the tie is SOCAL EDISON and they are flowing 12MW into Cali, going the opposite way of us way.

It is available 24hrs a day so lets take advantage of it as much as we can.
If you have any questions over the weekend call me.

389,"you are long at np, because i did not put a imbalance deal in.  I figured you were going to sell that 10 mws of np length off to a sc on a realtime basis.  So, please take care of this"
390,"Group

We have 10 MW of length from Sierra through the APX light load at $185.  Stan purchased this NP15 length from the APX and it should be scheduled DA by Jeremy.  There should be a ECTRT load zone in PGE3 with this length.  Use whatever opportunities are out there (dynegy across COB or a straight export) to maximize this position.  The deal numbers are: 581335-purchase from APX and 581356-desk to desk deal.  Please make sure this gets taken care of.

Cheers
Jesse"

396,"FYI"
397,"Hey Guys.

I had a long talk with NCPA today and set up so that we again can do the ZP26/NP15 Buy-Resale on a Realtime basis. We are not doing a profit split this time, we are paying them $25/MW instead. This basically enables us to shift 21MW across PATH15 and not be subject to Congestion as NCPA has Grandfather Rights across the path. This is a sweet strategy when the SP15/NP15 spread is there and PATH15 is congested. NCPA's capacity is 21MW, but I would not recommend doing more than 20MW. There are others who know about this opportunity but are not currently using it (WESCO especially). So by doing only  20MW we do not remind them of NCPA.

The way this works is that we call NCPA and ask their capacity across PATH15. And tell them you want to schedule the BR through whatever hour.

IN CAPS:
We sell to NCPA in ZP26.
We buy from NCPA in NP15.

We can buy SP15 to fill our ZP26 sale (we just shift the load from SP15 to ZP26, so enter a EPMI CALPOOL).
PG&E is NCPA's SC, so if you are not passing Phase two give them a call.



NCPA's tel#: (916) 786-3520
PG&E tel# : (415) 973-1969

If you guys have any questions  just ask me.

Geir"
398,"Just a reminder that when entering a wheel, the Interchange ID must be the same for the import and export.  When the Import is labeled as ""EPMI_CISO_**"" and the Export as ""CISO_EPMI_**,"" the ISO views these as unique imports and exports.  They will not be linked together for a wheel, thus causing ancillary services charges to occur.

Thank you!"
