Kevin

I am a project manager with Harris Group in Denver.  We specialize in the
design of compressor stations and have considerable experience in the
western U.S.  I was hoping to get an update from you on the Sun Devil
Expansion project.  Have you applied with FERC?  Is there any opportunity
for our company to submit a proposal for the project?  Would you like to see
a Qualification Package that expands on our experience?

Thanks in advance for your assistance.
