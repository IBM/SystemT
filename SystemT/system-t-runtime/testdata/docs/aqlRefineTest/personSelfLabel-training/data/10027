I've asked jeff golden to get with you regarding the meeting we've discussed having with Bill Wise and or Ralph Eads of El Paso to go over list of opportunities we are talking to various epg business units about. If this meeting is next week I recommend you,mcconnel and either mitch taylor or jeff golden attend. Purpose is to give them an overall pespective of what we are trying to accomplish and to avoid the fire sale appearance.
