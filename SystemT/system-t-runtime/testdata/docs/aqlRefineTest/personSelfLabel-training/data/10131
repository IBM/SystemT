Kevin,
Just a short note to say thanks for taking a few moments to meet with me.
I'd like to stay in touch with the AZ project, as you know. In fact, I may
be in AZ later this week, if I can arrange this meeting. If I go, I'll stop
by visit Gary D. at Pinnacle West.

If anything comes up with your career, do let me know.

Regards,

Clark Ashton
