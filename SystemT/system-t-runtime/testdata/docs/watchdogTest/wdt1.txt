I examined the local analysis speed issue.   The picture is not clear yet.   Here's a record of what I saw just for reference.
1. Of the 5M docs done on avatar7,  most took a few ms to finish, but about 20k took more than a second.    The fast and slow documents seem to form two very distinct groups.   There are very few documents that took between 20ms to 200ms.
2. If  we assume that there are 20k slow documents, and that on average they take 500 times amount of time compared with fast documents, then this is equivalent to adding 10M fast documents.    The time taken for 15M documents would be reasonable. 
3. To find out which documents are slow, I compared the relative speed of each document.   Since the documents  are given out in order, their return order can be used as an idication of time cost.  For example, if document 200 was finished after document 250 had already finished, then during the time it was being processed, the other threads processed at least 50 documents.   very supprisingly, there are no document that are overly excessive by this measures.  The most is around 130 times the other documents.    This is a very small number, considering that  only about 1/2 of the docids exist in this db and there are 4 threads.  (In a previous run when a particular regular expressions was costly, we saw documents taking 5000 times as long as their peers).     
The last point is very puzzling relating to the observation that the documents are divided into fast and slow groups.

Note:
1. This is the printout of one thread, which dealt with about 1.27M documents.   There are 4 such threads.
2. The columns labeled 0, 1, 2, 3, etc are the histograms for documents that took between 2^(n-1) and 2^n ms, except column 0 contains everything below 1ms.
3. The column named 'total' is the total time (in ms) taken by all documents in this step.
4. The total time this thread lived translates to 18:48:03.  This not a sum of the steps, so it is not an indication that no time is lost to IO.
The most time consuming steps are as follows.  It appears that

we will need to debug this once we have the second run set up -- as to why some documents are taking so long.  Is there any facility in your code to flag such documents ? My worry is that the second loan will be about 29 hours or so with the current speed !  But c'est la vie.

Re: w3 run status
1) complete run
The run started last night was unexpectedly stow.  It is currently running db2 index for local annotations.  The finished steps are the following
init_aom            0: 0: 3      0.0h
run_local          18:48:13     18.8h
load_local          3:46: 7      3.8h
The local analysis took about three time as long as expected (130 docid/s).    I have checked several times on the local analysis.   The average speed was similar to what we used to have (around 300 to 500 docid/s).    This means that the slow down is likely caused by a few documents taking extremely long time.   The loading time seems normal.
2) import
We tuned various db2 parameters.   We were finally able to use 'db2 load' to load the data.    ('db2 import' was an order of magnitude slower.) 
Current estimate of the otal load time is between 10 to 12 hours.    I'll start a run on the whole set when the load finishes.

w3 run status
The three machines, avatar[789], ended up having very different number of documents.   (See below)
The exporting of the data finished this afternoon.
The importing takes much longer.  I rebooted all three machines and restarted the importing.   It'll take overnight.
Since avatar7 already have 5M documents, I started a run on avatar7.   It should finish around 15 hours.   Once the import finishes I'll start a run on all the data.
The code change will finish tomorrow morning and a run can start at that time.
Stats for this crawl:  The data are stored in w3db5 on the 3 hosts.   The merged data will be in w3db6. Current sizes in w3db5 are as follows:
		stored docs	 size		export time
avatar7: 	5094692	106G		4.5h
avatar8: 	2505086	  47G		1.5h
avatar9:  	  778820	  22G		0.8h
Total:		8378598	175G	
Note:
1. The document stored is about 92% of documents received ( 9121581)
2. Of  the documents stored, about 8% were from earlier crawls.  The docid range for current crawl is (746459, 9121581),
3. The numbers in the above two notes are completely independent.  They both give about 8.38M docs by coinsidence.   The actual stored docs for this crawl is approx 7.7M.
