Attention System Administrators!
IBM is sponsoring this year's SAGE (
http://www.sage.org/
) survey of computer system administrators. Please take a moment to 
complete the survey.
The survey is aimed at collecting and comparing salary information for Professional System Administrators, but it also gathers information about working conditions and technology trends.
The survey takes 10-20 minutes, since it gathers a lot of data.  It is well worth it, though!
Filling out the survey benefits the participant, because they get access to the data as soon as it's tabulated (and can find out how their compensation and working conditions compare to others)
Filling out the survey benefits IBM, since it is an incredibly rich source of information about system administrator work, helping us build better tools to meet actual working conditions.

A New Breed of Enterprise Intelligence
Monday, Dec. 3, 2 - 3 p.m.
SVL, K222
Sponsored by the Technical Vitality Council
Speaker: Jeff Jonas, chief scientist and IBM Distinguished Engineer, Threat and Fraud Intelligence, Entity Analytic Solutions
Common strategies to liberate an organization,s information assets for enterprise awareness frequently rely on infrastructure components such as data integration, enterprise search, federation, data warehousing, and so on.  And while these traditional platforms enable analysts to get better and faster answers to their queries, the next big advance will change this paradigm.
Users cannot be expected to formulate and ask every smart question every day.  To escape this impractical and un-scalable model, the new paradigm will involve technologies where &the data finds the data and relevance finds the user.8
Furthermore, as pressures to share information both intra- and inter- company, organizations face unprecedented data governance challenges.  How can organizations move more data and make more sense of this data -- while simultaneous reducing the risk of unintended disclosure?  To answer this call, a new breed of technology is emerging where not only does "the data find the data," but the data that flows and the analytics that make sense of this data ... operate exclusively in the anonymized data space.  
Jeff Jonas
Chief Scientist and IBM Distinguished Engineer
Threat & Fraud Intelligence
Entity Analytic Solutions
IBM
Jeff Jonas is chief scientist of the Entity Analytic Solutions group and an IBM Distinguished Engineer.  In these capacities, he is responsible for shaping the overall technical strategy of next generation identity analytics and the use of this new capability in the overall IBM technology strategy. 
The IBM Entity Analytic Solutions group was formed based on technologies developed by Mr. Jonas as the founder and chief scientist of Systems Research & Development (SRD).  SRD was acquired by IBM in January 2005.
Today, Mr. Jonas applies his real world and hands on experience in software design and development to drive technology innovations while delivering higher levels of privacy and civil liberties protections.  By way of example, the most recent breakthrough developed by Mr. Jonas involves an innovative technique enabling advanced data correlation while only using irreversible cryptographic hashes.  This new capability makes it possible for organizations to discover records of common interest (e.g., identities) without the transfer of any privacy invading content.  This privacy-enhancing technology known as anonymous entity resolution delivers extraordinary new levels of privacy protection while enabling technology to contribute to critical societal interests like clinical health care research, aviation safety, homeland security, fraud detection and identity theft.
Jeff Jonas,s innovations have received coverage in such publications as The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Fortune, and Computerworld and have been featured on ABC Primetime with Peter Jennings, The Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel and MSNBC. Known for his dynamic presentational style, he is a popular speaker on technology, security and privacy and has spoken at events such as the Federal Convention on Emerging Technologies Forum on Homeland Security, National Security Agency,s INFOSEC Seminar Series, American Society for Industrial Security, Black Hat, PC Forum, Wharton Technology Conference, National Retail Federation Annual Fraud Conference and Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference. 
Mr. Jonas is a member of the Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security in the Information Age and actively contributes his insights on privacy, technology and homeland security to leading national think tanks, privacy advocacy groups, and policy research organizations, including the Center for Democracy and Technology, Heritage Foundation and the Office of the Secretary of Defense Highlands Forum.

Photography lost its innocence many years ago.ÿ Shortly after the first commercially available camera was introduced, photographs were being manipulated and altered.ÿ With the advent of high-resolution digital cameras, powerful personal computers and sophisticated photo-editing software, the manipulation of digital images is becoming more common.ÿ We are seeing the impact of these technologies in nearly every corner of our lives.ÿ As the technology that allows for digital media to be manipulated and distorted is developing at break-neck speeds, our understanding of the technological, ethical, and legal implications is lagging behind.ÿ I will discuss some of these issues and describe computational techniques which we have developed for detecting tampering in digital media.ÿ Operating in the absence of digital watermarks or signatures, these techniques quantify and detect statistical, optical, and geometric correlations that result from specific forms of digital tampering.

Quarterly Network Outage dates for 2007
This is a reminder about the Networking Services - Integrated Technology Delivery Quarterly Network Outage dates for the remainder of 2007. 
Fourth Quarter - 17 Nov 2007 from 08:00 to 23:59 PT
In order to help you keep these dates in mind, we are providing these buttons to add reminders about the outages to your Lotus Notes calendar.
IMPORTANT:  Use each button only once!  Reminders will be added every time you click the button!
The first button will add reminders for each of the actual outage dates.
The second button will add advance reminders for the second Monday prior to each outage date.
These outages will affect the entire SVL Network (Complex1, Complex2, SCO, Wireless), as well as the SVL Site access to WAN and Internet. These extended outage windows allow for the twice-yearly PDT Template upgrades (IBM-required code and security updates), which often need to be applied to all of the San Francisco Bay Area MAN sites during the same outage window.  
This scheduled network outage information is documented and available on the SVL Network web pages:  
http://w3.svl.ibm.com/network/outages.html

IBM copy centers help OTTOs with bulk printing jobs
Printing sales presentations, plans and other bulk documents can be a nightmare on a home printer. But just because you work off-site doesn't mean you can't take advantage of IBM's REPRO Centers. No matter where your work location is in the United States, you can take advantage of IBM on-site professional document production services for your copy and printing needs. Using IBM's on-site copy centers is significantly cheaper than using external retail copy centers, even those that have negotiated rates with IBM. Also, you can expect high quality output as IBM has just refreshed their reprographics copier equipment nationwide. In addition, IBM's copy centers are:
