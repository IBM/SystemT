Subject: FW: Notice of Lodgment - Legislative Counsel Opinion


Chris,

Please see the attached tif file containing a very important CA legislative
counsel opinion that we should also consider lodging w/ the court or at
least using in our various pleadings.  I thought I sent it around a few days
ago.  Apparently there was a problem.  Please forward as needed.

Alex
