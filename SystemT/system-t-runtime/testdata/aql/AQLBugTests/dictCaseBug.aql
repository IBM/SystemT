-- Test of a bug in handling the new case-sensitivity parameters for 
-- dictionaries.
--

require document with columns text Text;



-- Old way
create dictionary NoCaseDict as ('US');

create view US1 as 
extract dictionary 'NoCaseDict'
	with flags 'Exact' on D.text as match
from Document D;

-- New way
create dictionary CaseDict 
	with language as 'en'
	and case exact
as ('US');

-- Other new way
create dictionary CaseDict2
	from file 'dictionaries/country.dict'
	with language as 'en'
	and case exact;


create view US2 as
extract dictionary 'CaseDict' on D.text as match
from Document D;

create view US3 as
extract dictionary 'CaseDict2' on D.text as match
from Document D;

output view US1;
output view US2;
output view US3;
