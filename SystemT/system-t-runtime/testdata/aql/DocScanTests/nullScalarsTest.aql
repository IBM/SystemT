--- This testcase validates handling a null argument to scalar functions.
--- The 'url' field in the JSON input file is sometimes null, so any scalar function that uses it will have to handle null 
--- Current scalar functions tested: GetString(), GetText(), and Chomp()

require document with columns
  id Integer
  and label Text
  and text Text
  and url Text
  and timeStamp Text;

-- Test null argument to GetString 
create view dumpURL as 
select GetString(D.url) as urlout from Document D;

output view dumpURL;


create view dumpURL2 as 
select GetText(D.url) as urlout from Document D;

output view dumpURL2;


create view Links as 
select Chomp(D.url) as link
from Document D;

output view Links;
