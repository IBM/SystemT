-- Test cases for queries that look for documents containing certain
-- identifiers.


-- Test 1:
-- Find all documents that contain at least one element from three different
-- dictionaries, also outputting the intermediate steps (e.g. one dictionary,
-- two dictionaries...)
create dictionary Dict1 as (
	'big', 'large', 'huge', 'gargantuan'
);

create dictionary Dict2 as (
	'happy', 'blissful', 'glad', 'elated'
);

create dictionary Dict3 as (
	'family'
);

-- Find all documents containing words from Dict1
create view Set1 as
select D.text as text
from Document D
where ContainsDict('Dict1', D.text);

-- Find all docs containing at least one of Dict1 and Dict2
create view Set1_2 as
select S.text as text
from Set1 S
where ContainsDict('Dict2', S.text);

-- Find all docs containing at least one of Dict1, Dict2, Dict3
create view Set1_2_3 as
select S.text as text
from Set1_2 S
where ContainsDict('Dict3', S.text);

-- Alternate version that does all 3 steps in a single statement.
create view Set1_2_3_Alt as
select D.text as text
from Document D
where ContainsDict('Dict1', D.text)
  and ContainsDict('Dict2', D.text)
  and ContainsDict('Dict3', D.text);

-- Retrieve the actual words that matched.
create view Words1_2_3 as

	on S.text as word
