* This module is used as the container of all features defined towards extracting financial metrics indicators. These features have been
* broken down into basics, concepts and refinements accordingly. Basics contain simple features that are eventually used in defining more
* indicative candidate instances of some pattern of a financial metric. Refinements contain the final set of patterns that would eventually
* extract the financial metric indicators, after some constraint based refinements to the candidates extracted previously.
