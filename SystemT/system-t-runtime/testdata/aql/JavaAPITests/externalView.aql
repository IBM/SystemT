-- Test case for bug #163163:	SystemT.SIngle.getExternalViewSchema() fails in certain cases
--

-- Declare an external view that is populated at runtime
create external view Word(match Span) 
external_name 'Word'; 

-- Select the contents of the external view
-- Causes the plan nodes for Word and WordAll to be merged into a single node, 
-- causing the invocation of SystemT.Single.getExternalViewSchema("Word") to fail.
create view WordAll as 
select * 
from Word; 

-- Select the contents of the external view, but join with Document 
-- to make sure the plan nodes of Word and WordAll are not merged.
/*
create view WordAll as 
select W.* 
from Word W, Document D; 
*/

output view WordAll;
