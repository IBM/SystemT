/**
* Test case for defect 35244: Text Analytics Runtime : SRM [Shared Regex Matching] optimization issue with modular NER AQL.
* Create two views that use regular expressions and generate SRM nodes in AOG. Similarly create a second module with two different regexes, 
* and with extract output columns of different names than the ones used in this module. 
* Attempt to run both the modules together. Ideally, there should not be any problem. However, due to a bug in SRM optimization, 
* the user is forced to name all the output columns to same name for these AQLs to work together.
