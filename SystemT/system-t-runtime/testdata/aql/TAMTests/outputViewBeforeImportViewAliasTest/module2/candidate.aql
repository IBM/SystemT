-- Attempting to output the view View1Alias, even before its import statement is processed in 'import.aql'.
-- Remember that AQL Parser parses files in alphabetical order of file name. 
-- So, when the parse tree node for output statement below is added to catalog,
-- the entry for the imported view View1Alias (found in 'import.aql') may not have been parsed yet. 
-- Before the fix for defect 55044, AOG contained the following incorrect stmt: Output: $_{"module2.View1Alias");
-- After the fix, the AOG is correctly generated as: Output: $_{"module1.View1");
