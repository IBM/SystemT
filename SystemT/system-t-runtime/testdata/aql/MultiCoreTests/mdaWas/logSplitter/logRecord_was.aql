-- Split the WAS log record as:  
-- (i) Exception Trace Blocks
-- (ii) Each line from the input log which does not belong to a trace block
-- ******************************************

--In place of the "Doc" view that detag.aql would generate:
create view Doc as select D.text from Document D;

include 'logRecord_singleLine.aql';
include 'logRecord_stackTrace.aql';

-- (A) get single line records that overlap with any stack trace
create view SingleLine_OverTrace as
	select L.logSpan as logSpan
	from SingleLine L, TraceBlockOutput T
	where Overlaps(L.logSpan, T.span);


-- (B) remove all single line entries that overlap with any stack trace
create view SingleLine_NoTrace as 
    (
		select L.logSpan as logSpan
		from SingleLine L
    )
    minus
    (
		select L.logSpan as logSpan
		from SingleLine_OverTrace L
    );
    
-- (C) merge single lines of (A) that form the beginning of a stack trace
create view SingleLine_MergeTrace as
		select CombineSpans(L.logSpan, T.span) as logSpan
		from SingleLine_OverTrace L, TraceBlockOutput T
		where Overlaps(L.logSpan, T.span) 
		and GreaterThan(GetBegin(T.span), GetBegin(L.logSpan));

-- (D) merge all to get the final list
create view LogRecord_Intermediate as
	(
		select L.logSpan as logSpan
		from SingleLine_NoTrace L
    )
    union all
    (
		select S.logSpan as logSpan
		from SingleLine_MergeTrace S
    );

-- (E) create the output view
create view LogRecord as
	select L.logSpan as logSpan, GetText(L.logSpan) as logText
	from LogRecord_Intermediate L;

output view LogRecord;
