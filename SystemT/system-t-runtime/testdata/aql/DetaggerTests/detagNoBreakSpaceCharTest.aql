/* 
- Goal
Assert expected behavior when detagging non-breaking space characters in input HTML.

- Context
A non-breaking space character can either be represented as: 
1. a valid HTML entity such as &nbsp; or &#160; or &#0160; 
2. or, a unicode codepoint \u00A0

- Expected behavior
Each such character is normalized into a single whitespace character ' '.
