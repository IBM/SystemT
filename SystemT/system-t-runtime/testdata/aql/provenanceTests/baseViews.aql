-- Test case for bug #14117: Provenance viewer for japanese collection 
-- just displays 'All Results'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Find capitalized words using sequence pattern which 
-- is not supported by the provenance rewrite, 
-- therefore it will be marked as base view
create view CapsWord as 
extract 
    pattern /[A-Z][a-z]+/ as name
from Document D;

-- Make a copy of the CapsWord view
create view CapsWordCopy as
select *
from CapsWord;

output view CapsWordCopy;
