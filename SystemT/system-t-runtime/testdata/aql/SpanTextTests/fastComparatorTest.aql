-- RTC 167415: Comparison of Span objects derived from distinct DocumentText objects (but with similar underlying String content) is incomplete

-- Create two distinct document-Text objects but containing similar String contents
detag Document.text as DetaggedDocument1;
detag Document.text as DetaggedDocument2;

create dictionary dictTextDoc as ('Text Document');
create dictionary dictDoc as ('Document');

-- Two dictionaries are applied on one document-Text object while the third is applied on the other document-Text object
-- Union the resulting TupleLists together into one TupleList
create view ViewA as
	(select V.* from 
		(
			extract
			D1.text as text,
			dictionary dictTextDoc on D1.text as match
			from DetaggedDocument1 D1
