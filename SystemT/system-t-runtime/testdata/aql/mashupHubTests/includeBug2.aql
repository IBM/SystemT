-- includeBug2.aql
--
-- A bug in include processing that turned up during the development
-- of the MashupHub annotators.
--
-- The bug turned out to involve not detecting when an input file is
-- not in the right encoding.
---------------------------------------

-- Start by creating stubs for views that will be referenced later.
create view The as 
extract regex /the/ on 1 token in D.text as the
from Document D;

create view CompanyInfoShort as
	select '' as exchange, '' as ticker, '' as companyname, '' as rule,
		T.the as match
	from The T;
	
create view CompanyInfoLong as
	select '' as exchange, '' as ticker, '' as companyname, '' as rule,
		T.the as match
	from The T;


-- Then include the problem files.
include 'includeBug2/preprocess.aql';
include 'includeBug2/merger.aql';

output view MergerWithStatusShort;
