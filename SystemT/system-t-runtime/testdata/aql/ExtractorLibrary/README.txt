NOTE FROM LAURA 2/10/2012:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This folder contains a copy of the "core" NER extractors obtained from the 
ExtractorLibrary project on 2/10/2012. These extractors are the original "core" 
version, not the core-updated, or the core-updated-refactored version. 
These extractors have been copied here so that we can get our original Runtime 
regression tests working again with the original extractors. Additional 
regression tests that cover the core-updated-refactored library 
should be added either in the Runtime project or in the ExtractorLibrary project.
