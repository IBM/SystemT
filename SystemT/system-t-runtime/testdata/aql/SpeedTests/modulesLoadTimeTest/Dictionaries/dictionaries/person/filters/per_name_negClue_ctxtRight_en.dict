#* This dictionary contains a list of clues used to disambiguate between a person entity and a non-person entity based on its presence
#* to the right of a person entity, for instance. Example - The Chavez airport - Chavez may be a person's name, but the use of airport 
#* immediately to its right would suggest this span to not be indicative of a person entity, but something else.
