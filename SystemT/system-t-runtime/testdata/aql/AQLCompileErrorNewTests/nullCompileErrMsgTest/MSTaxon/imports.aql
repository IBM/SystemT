-- We compare Noun Phrases in the Subject field, with Noun Phrases the Sentiment Object,
-- so we need Noun Phrases from the Action API
import view NounPhrases from module ActionAPI as NounPhrases;

-- the extracted Sentiment
import view Sentiment from module MSCaseSentiment as Sentiment; 

-- and the Subject field
import view Field_Subject from module ms_split_doc as Field_Subject;

-- We also need the rest of the Structured and Unstructured fields, so we can output
-- the category, subcategory and subject associated with each sentiment,
-- as well as the specific unstructured field where the sentiment is found
import view Field_Unstructured from module ms_split_doc as Field_Unstructured;
import view Field_Category from module ms_split_doc as Field_Category;
import view Field_Subcategory from module ms_split_doc as Field_Subcategory;

-- Finally, we need the sentences, so we output the entire sentence 
-- where a sentiment is found, for a more informative output
import view Sentences from module sentences as Sentences;
