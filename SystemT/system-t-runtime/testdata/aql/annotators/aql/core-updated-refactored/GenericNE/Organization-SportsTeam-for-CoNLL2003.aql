-- Sudarshan regex : 10/12/2011 : lines 18, 28, 36, 44 and 52 - should the \p{Lu}\p{M}* below be grouped together, inside the [ ] ? 
-- Had the above doubt because am still unsure if \p{Lu}\p{M}* is read as one character or unicode point within the [ ] or two 
-- if the latter, then it should be grouped, for the [ ] instructs the engine to output only that one unicode point / character whichever matched.
-- I have grouped them at least on two occasions together when changing the regex syntax, so a clarification here would help me attend to them too if those changes need to be reverted.
